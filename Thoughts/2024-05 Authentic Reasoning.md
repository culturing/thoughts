Authentic Reasoning
May 2025

### - 1 -

- Synthetic *a priori* judgments are not necessary for metaphysics.
- All that is necessary is failed expectations.

### - 2 -

- We have a concept of a thing.
- This concept always includes expectations about how the thing will behave.
- It's actual behavior differs from the expected, causing wonder.
- Thus begins philosophy.

### - 3 -

- The first inkling of a thing-in-itself, a beyond, a more-than-meets-the-eye, comes when a thing fails to meet our expectations.
- It surprises us.
- It must have properties that we did not take into account.

### - 4 -

- This is the root of all negative theologies.

### - 5 -

- One of the most important skills for a human to learn is how to navigate through confusion.
- The confusion must not be encouraged, but cannot be avoided.
- We cannot defeat it with violence, in Roman style.
- We must learn to wander through it.

### - 6 -

- We in the West are acclimated to clarity.
- We have ascended the hills of the gods and seen further than others.
- But how shall we adjust to the thick air of the earth?
- Hilltop habits are no use here.

### - 7 -

- We have hints of a "higher" reality.
- But these only indicate faults in our thinking.
- They cannot indicate more.

### - 8 -

- Thus far with Kant.
- But Kant still wants to rescue mankind from confusion.
- I think he was confused about this.
- There is no rescue.
- But he was not the first to seek one.

### - 9 -

- Plato struggled in the contest to make clear hints of a "higher" reality.
- He succeeded admirably. The hints are still unclear.
- Perhaps his struggle is ethical, not scientific.

### - 10 -

- Aristotle made the hints much clearer.
- For this reason, his philosophy (in the hands of others) became dogmatic and tyrannical.

### - 11 -

- Kant inherited a lust for clarity.
- He found a new means to that end.
- But how is reason more clear than things-in-themselves?
- "Reason" is not better than "substance" or other terms of the schoolmen.
- We cannot nail it down.
- We do not know what reason is, any more than we know anything else.
- We cannot know reason as it is in itself.
- Thus the psychologists, disturbed by what lies under reason (Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, James, Freud)
- The psychologists still hear the hints.

### - 12 -

- But we need not be disturbed by hints.
- We must learn to wander, even through our own selves.
- Only then can we find the way.
- It will not be provided for us.
- Who could provide it?

### - 13 -

- Nature is wild energies at war.
- Chaos is normal. Order is rare.
- But for that reason order is precious. 
- We cannot live without it.
- It is not precious because it conforms to nature.
- It is precious because it resists nature.
- We build structures to keep nature out.
- Otherwise nature would kill us.

### - 14 -

- One of those structures has been metaphysics.
- It has served a purpose but can do so no longer.
- What else can serve this purpose?

### - 15 -

- Things are never what they used to be.
- This is another way in which they surprise us.
- They change over time.
- We call this history.
- What would it mean to belong within history?
- To situate oneself in a stream of ideas flowing through a community over time?
- How important it would be to leave good ideas behind!
- For those to come! For those to come!

### - 16 -

- Kant's dissection of reason has killed the patient.
- Reason has become too self-aware.
- It is time for a new beginning.
- But what is old is new again.

### - 17 -

- We carry history within us.
- In our bones, in our hearts, in our DNA.
- Why have we not attended to it?
- It is always there waiting for us.

### - 18 -

- I am not sure that there are any *a priori* judgments at all.
- Infants cannot do math.
- Children learn by counting objects.
- They carry those memories with them into every calculation.
- What Kant called *a priori* are really products of learning.
- They are habits, based on prior experience.
- Even Kant's favorite example, 7 + 5 = 12, fails.
- We experience a group of objects.
- These groups can be divided into smaller groups.
- Thus a group of 12 can be divided into groups of 7 and 5.
- This is part of the concept of a positive integer.
- Therefore by Kant's definition it is analytic, and the object analyzed is the sum.

### - 19 -

- More interesting is the nature of whole and parts.
- What is a One?
- I have one body, but that body is arms and legs and hair, and each of these is blood and tissue and muscle, etc.
- So in what sense do I have *one* body?
- It seems to be a product of reason.
- But my reason, or cosmic reason?
- This is a very old question.

### - 20 -

- Probably my reason.
- Again thus far with Kant, but also with Parmenides, Plato, and Plotinus.
- The uneasiness of reason will not easily be sloughed off.

### - 21 -

- Natural law (with its bastard Deism) was a grave error.
- There are no laws of nature.
- Law is a human creation.
- Nature has patterns, but who knows if they will continue?
- Do we not experience frequent surprises?
- What could enforce the "laws of nature?"
- Is nature not free to disobey?

### - 22 -

- Reason conforms to supposed laws of nature at its peril.
- Reason must impose order on chaos.
- Postmoderns face this dilemma: reason or chaos?
- But we must have both.
- Reason is the master of chaos.
- Chaos is what calls for reason.

### - 23 -

- It bears repeating that reason does not imitate nature.
- Nothing in nature resembles human laws.
- Nothing in nature can ground human laws.
- Reason opposes nature.
- But this opposition is the fundamental human experience.
- We must stop viewing nature as a rational whole.
- We must attend to those parts of it that we can master.
- But we will never master all of it.
- Even the attempt is hubris, and we are guilty of this arrogance.

### - 24 -

- How much of nature (or how many natures) have we mastered?
- It varies.
- But always keep watch for the charlatans who claim to have mastered all.
- You will know them by your sense of unease.
- Do not reach for heaven when earth will do.
- But do not settle for earth uninformed.
- This last has its charlatans too.

### - 25 -

- We must continue to think about the parts of nature that are beyond reason.
- We cannot organize them, but we can organize ourselves in light of them.
- We must be orderly, even when nature is disorderly.
- This is reason's highest purpose.

### - 26 -

- Nature is not our role model.
- Nature is only itself.
- A belief in natural law no longer helps us.
- It has damaged our sexuality.
- It has damaged our self-esteem.
- These are bitter pills, though clich√©.
- We need a new style of reasoning.

### - 27 -

- The new reason must be lighthearted and free from absolutes.
- It must tolerate disagreement.
- It must play with its subject.
- It must not dominate.
- *It must be authentic*.
