Thinking Again
February 2024

### - 1 -

- What Bacon calls Idols do inhibit rational thought, but they are also the foundation of community.
- They enable shared belief.

### - 2 -

- Science is here to stay, but it must not rule.
- It must learn its subordinate place.

### - 3 -

- But subordinate to whom? Not the Volk...
- Perhaps to a species of man which has rarely prospered in the West: the Chun-tzse, the master of culture, humbled by much study, ruled by intelligence, and ruling in kind.
- But what is this intelligence if not scientific? Not Christian either...
- It is wise, far-seeing, strategic, long-term, with its roots and its blossoms in *memory*, not in *power*.

### - 4 -

- First we revere the past.
- Then we make the present worthy of reverence, by means of the past, for the sake of the future.
- What kind of world? What kind of world?
- Man's limits are not what we think they are.
- Perhaps we have had false gods, but that does not mean all gods are false.
- Conduct must be governed somehow.
- We live no other way.
- Freedom is a god, and a questionable one. 
- Tomorrow we may have another god.

### - 5 -

- The Germans are always sacking Rome. They cannot help it.
- What was the Reformation if not another sack of Rome?
- Perhaps some of Rome is worth keeping.
- Perhaps some of Germany is worth keeping too.

### - 6 -

- Why did Rome need to be sacked?
- Was it too omnipotent?
- Did it rule by force and repress nature?

### - 7 -

- The lesson of Rome is that no power can be universal.
- The Romans did not know what was good for Germany, or for Greece, or for Asia Minor, or for Israel.
- They only knew what was good for Rome (if that).

### - 8 -

- There are many forms of rule, and *imperium* is only the most common in the West.
- Imperium is spectacularly efficient but stifles creativity and initiative.
- It is only for people who know the answers in advance.
- It is only for people who know the questions in advance.
- It is not for people who discover.

### - 9 -

- The scientific method was a sharp break from imperium.
- It claims that human knowledge is always provisional. Discovery is essential.
- This was necessary in order to secure for thinking a place where things can change.
- But it is not necessary that all things be subject to change at all times.
- This is a new, nasty, scientific imperialism, commanding disobedience, perennial re-evaluation, skepticism.
- How can we obey? How can we disobey?

### - 10 -

- Let us think harder before we obey.
- Let us think harder before we disobey.
- Let us think and then decide.
- The answers may not be known until there has been thinking.
- The questions may not be known until there has been thinking.

### - 11 -

- Nature is not lawful in the way the Romans were lawful.
- It is not so efficient.
- It is prone to accidents and wild chance.
- The gods can be abusive.
- We should not necessarily imitate gods or Nature (which is only a god)
- But this is a sign that something is wrong with our gods.

### - 12 -

- Imperium does not belong to the cosmos.
- Imperium is manmade, and can be unmade.
- What happens to us when we unmake it?
- Are we "lost in an endless nothing?"

### - 13 -

- We are not lost in an endless nothing, though we were for a time.
- We are not gods ourselves, though we were for a time.
- We are the ones who tell stories about the gods.
- We can always tell new stories.
- But we must not abuse this privilege.
- Our lives depend on it.

### - 14 -

- What is a story worth telling?

### - 15 -

- We are now two-hundred years into the experiment of making every man a king.
- Allow me to suggest that it is not going well.
- Where is the noble self-discipline?

### - 16 -

- The West has always had trouble organizing itself.
- We like war too much.
- We like money too much.
- We do not like good government enough.

### - 17 -

- One can only assume that our mistrust of government is well-earned.
- But that only means that we must govern better.
- We must also *be governed* better, be more governable.
- The obligation goes both ways.

### - 18 -

- A good governor first governs himself.
- If he cannot do this, how can he govern others?
- If he can do this, what more is required?

### - 19 -

- Luck is required, and rare.
- But we must do all that we can.

### - 20 -

- Every belief can be questioned.
- Or can it?

### - 21 -

- Descartes' *cogito ergo sum*, I think therefore I am, was meant to provide certainty.
- It does not succeed.
- Grounding certainty on thinking makes both silly.
- Thinking is more akin to uncertainty.
- Certainty comes from elsewhere.

### - 22 -

- Certainty belongs to the realm of religion.
- Some raise Cartesian scientism to the level of religion.
- This makes actual thinking impossible, because authentic thinking never knows where (or if) it will arrive.
- For Cartesians (as for Calvinists), certainty is a forgone conclusion.

### - 23 -

- Why did such a love of certainty emerge?
- It must be from the Romans, who loved obedience and considered authorities absolute.
- But this Roman obedience has merged with Greek thoughtfulness to create a certainty fetish.
- Thinking and believing must be kept separate.
- The tyranny of thoughts is the most common tyranny today.
- This would have been foreign to Greeks or Romans, though both have contributed to it.
- What can govern us, it not ideas we hold certain?
- What can govern us, if no idea is certain?

### - 24 -

- We need new and better examples.
- Examples of both thinking and obedience, kept apart.
- There is a time to think and a time to obey.
- And there are some who have done each well.
- But there are few who have done both well.

### - 25 -

- I doubt they can be done together.
- Thinking is for the few, belief for the many.
- These few do not think in order to believe or believe in order to think.
- They think in order to think.
- Likewise, the many believe in order to believe.

### - 26 -

- Why not simply "I am"?
- What does the "cogito ergo" add?
- But "I am" has been spoken before, by one more powerful than Descartes.
- Would Descartes take His place via thinking?
- Would Science take His place via thinking?
- Is he founding a religion?

### - 27 -

- He is founding the echo of a religion, or better, of three religions.
- He is composing a new harmony of the same old motifs.
- Are we not tired of these songs?
- Are we not tired of the ways in which they never fit together?
- What is *our* motif?

### - 28 -

- It is time that we think again.
- Time, time, time...with all of its random interjections, the past as harmful as helpful.
- How are we unlike the Romans?

### - 30 -

- We do not believe that we are close to the gods.
- We do not believe in ourselves.
- Instead, we believe in Democracy, Science, etc...methods and processes.
- How is a method not simply a ritual?
- Why do we expect our rituals to succeed?

### - 31 -

- Because the Romans taught us this expectation.
- It has no ground under it.
- We can do the right thing and still fail.
- It happens all the time.

### - 32 - 

- We may be more likely to succeed if we do the right thing.
- But there is no guarantee.
- We may be more likely to fail if we do the wrong thing.
- But there is no guarantee.

### - 33 -

- We must stop blaming victims of cosmic caprice.
- Pain does not imply moral failure.
- Pain implies only itself.
- Blame leads to repression, festering, monstrousness.
- Let the pain go. Release it. Be free.

### - 34 -

- But how can we release pain without causing harm?
- Carefully and in controlled spaces.
- Is this not also Roman?
- Perhaps it is not all bad.

### - 35 -

- The space between essence and appearance is what calls for thinking.
- This is in answer to Heidegger.
- Hegel identified essence with appearance.
- Thus, he disabled all thinking.
- But are things as they appear?
- Thinkers beg to differ.

### - 36 -

- What is there to think, except a hidden essence?
- What can ground authority, except skill with essence?
- Hegel's "essence = appearance" is egalitarian.
- It aims to make essence accessible to all.
- But it clouds the hidden essence. It lies. It deceives.
- Aristotle knew better.
- He was wise to separate potentials (essence) from actuals (appearance) and to base most of his philosophy on this distinction (notwithstanding Medieval corruptions of his thinking).
- But he may have overestimated his ability to speak clearly about hidden essences.
- Discovery is always delicate.
- Essence can only be seen with peripheral vision.
- Then again, maybe Aristotle knew this, and it is only his followers who do not.
- Is this why he wrote with broken syntax?

### - 37 -

- To do *that here* is not more offensive that to do *this there*.
- Both sides see clearly now.
- How can we learn from each other?
