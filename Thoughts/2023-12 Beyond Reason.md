Beyond Reason
December 2023

### - 1 -

- Philosophy begins with self-doubt, but it does not end with self-certainty. It does not end at all.
- Answers contain new questions.

### - 2 -

- At some point, one must stop being kind. What is that point?

### - 3 - 

- According to the Greeks, the gods want us to think.
- According to the Romans, the gods want us to obey.
- According to the Jews, God wants us to trust.
- Can all of these be true? Can none of them be true?

### - 4 -

- Philosophy does not solve problems. It only notices them.
- Problems are solved by practical action.
- Rarely, the notices of philosophy are heeded and the people prosper.
- More often, a particular philosophy is institutionalized, and the people suffer under its oppression.
- We must keep the living tree and not just its fruit.

### - 5 -

- Aquinas is supposed to have asked, "What is God?"
- Hegel's answer was that God is self-negating negation.
- Hegel criticizes Leibniz for being dogmatic, but Hegel has not fully freed himself from Christian dogma either.
- He assumes that features found in human rationality must therefore be features of the cosmos.
- Dialectic occurs in the minds of men, and only there.
- But it is important that it does occur there.

### - 6 -

- Ancient religion was less literal than modern religion.
- Religion is a line in the sand saying "cross and become my enemy."
- There is no reason why religion must involve superhuman beings.
- It involves an understanding between groups of people.
- Belief in a superhuman guardian is infantilizing. It does not produce strong people.
- How can we produce strong people?

### - 7 -

- Socrated asked, "Why have you not concerend yourself with the details?"
- Confucius answered, "I am only a man. Can I consider all details?"

### - 8 -

- Strength begins with humility, with some insight into the vast panoply of things unknown.
- Not to understand them, but to understand the limits of our understanding.
- Only with this understanding can we acquire appropriate fears.
- The fear of the unknown is the essential motivation. It is the impetus to acquire strength.
- Nothing is taken care of. Everything must be thought through.
- This is the attitude of the Chun-tzse or a Greek Philosopher.
- But not everything *can* be thought through, because humans have limits. Therefore, we must prioritize.
- But how can we order our priorities?

### - 9 -

- Confucius says that social harmony should come before food.
- Is this still believable? Was it ever believable?
- Perhaps in a time of warring states, this is believable.
- But we live in a time of too many social demands.
- Are they simply the wrong demands?
- Can we imagine a social order more valuable than food?
- One with no otherwordly beyond?

### - 10 -

- It is often asked, "if everyone jumped off a bridge, would you join them?"
- The point is that groups should not always be trusted.
- But I think the most human answer is "yes."
- It can be quite moving.
- In "Shoah," a Polish Jew tells a story about working in a Nazi camp.
- One day a trainload of Poles arrived and were sent to be gassed.
- He heard them singing the Polish national anthem and, weeping, threw down his broom and went in to join them.
- They told him, "No! What are you doing? You must live to tell the world about what has happened here."
- Is this not human? This desire to join the others even in death...what could be more human?

### - 11 - 

- Religion is also a way in which we clean ourselves in preparation for sex. 
- But what if the soap is dirty?

### - 12 -

- Big businesses are the greatest threat to community that the world has ever known.
- They cultivate predator/prey relationships.
- They commodify and objectify humans.
- How could we not imitate big businesses who do these things?

### - 13 -

- The human spirit cannot be measured objectively or evaluated.
- It must be lived before it can be understood.
- But markets are predicated on valuations.
- What is the value of friendship?

### - 14 -

- We want an authority that places spiritual things on par with material things.
- It must not ignore either.
- It must have an elastic intelligence, to oscillate between these very different considerations.
- It cannot objectify the spirit nor spiritualize the material.
- It must understand both as parts of one whole.

### - 15 -

- The Analytical and Continental schools of philosophy correspond roughly to material and spiritual.
- The Continental school is older, beginning with Hegel. The Analytical school is a reaction against Hegel.
- Hegel was too spiritual. His followers neglect objective analysis. 
- But he did recognize that Reason lives within each individual.
- It cannot be imposed from without (as Frederick the Great attempted) and still remain reason.
- The Analytical school is too anti-spiritual, as if sensing a danger in Hegel.
- Wittgenstein is a rebel, poking holes in Analytical hyper-objectivism.
- The conflict between these schools animated the world wars of the 20th Century.
- Both would do well to ask whether the cosmos is really rationally ordered.
- The conflict depends on differing understandings of the nature of reason.
- But both insist that the universe is goverend by reason.
- If the universe is not so governed, the conflict becomes merely a matter of taste.
- Let us hold a final dirge for cosmic reason. Our children will thank us.

### - 16 -

- But what can fill God's shoes?
- Surely not us, given what we are.
- Maybe new gods?
- But what is a god?

### - 17 -

- A god is a justification for conduct.
- Which conduct shall we justify?

### - 18 -

- Preferably not consumerism.
- Preferably not Marxism either, or any form of Hegelian dialecticism.
- Not Analytical hyper-rationality either.
- Probably not anything grounded in philosophy at all.

### - 19 -

- Philosophy is a critique of the gods and, by extension, of conduct.
- It can never erect new gods, except maybe the demon god of absolute spirit.
- Philosophy is an occasional practice for almost everyone.
- It is only a way of life for very few. 
- These few are characterized by self-doubt.
- But the religious life of the many should be more certain and clear. They themselves desire this.
- Of what should it be certain? It depends...

### - 20 -

- America is a strange place, or a strange collection of places.
- It has at least 50 living religions. Some have said it has 300 million gods.
- Perhaps we could do better with slightly fewer, with more cohesion.
- But we are brought together by frequent emergencies.
- Then we disperse, after crisis is averted, back to our household gods.
- Without a doubt, the many consider this cycle holy, as well they should.
- But some of us still doubt - can we do better? Can *we*?
- This cycle of benign neglect and coming together may be our true religion.
- At least, it is the best we can do, here and now.

### - 21 -

- But a danger lurks that emergencies will be manufactured in order to bring us together.
- This has happened before.
- But somehow it never takes hold once the crisis is over.
- What would we have to learn in order to remain in close contact with each other in the absence of an emergency?
- Confucian humaneness? Self-control?
- Can America learn these things and still be America?
- Do we have any choice? Will China influence us, like it or not?

### - 22 -

- Without self-restraint, there will always be friction between persons.
- With self-restraint, there may be slightly less friction.
- There will also be less freedom, but this is a trade worth considering.
