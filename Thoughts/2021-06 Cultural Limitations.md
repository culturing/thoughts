## Cultural Limitations

*For the Lady of Christ’s*

“Something completely clean can also be completely sterile” -  *Nixon, private memorandum, 1972*

### - 1 -

- A culture is a set of predispositions, habits, and rituals shared by a group of people.
- It is also a group of live bacteria in foods such as yogurt.
- These definitions have much in common.
- Our cultures come to us first through our mothers’ bodies.
- But there are many mothers’ bodies.
- Democracy is a way of organizing political life in which many people are given authority.
- Do these people have authority over mothers’ bodies?

### - 2 -

- That was a way of putting it.
- Bodies change over time. The study of this we call physics.
- The studies of more complex bodies have other names.
- One of the names for the study of political bodies is democracy.
- Political bodies are always composed of human bodies.
- They share similar features, like the relations of parts to wholes.
- To be political is, first and foremost, to have a body, and to be part of a body.
- I put my body into the larger body.
- Is this sexual? Almost. Or at least, eventually.
- This is a part of being a culture.
- This is being cultured.

### - 3 -

- Humans seem able to affect one another at a distance.
- Physicists have shown that fields act at a distance.
- Is this electrical? Maybe. Are our brains not electrical?
- Who has not noticed a moon and sensed that somewhere another was noticing the same moon?
- The art of cultivating these signals, transmitted one to another, is aesthetics.
- But first we must dampen the noise.

### - 4 -

- How terrifying, to know that there are others.
- Not only to know, but to feel them.
- We must not slink from the terror.

### - 5 -

- We must stop deceiving our children with the lie that they choose who they are.
- When we tell them this, we are making them into something.
- We should consider whether it is what we want them to be.
- But if not freedom, then what?
- A culture is not chosen. It is continued.
- Becoming informed by a culture is always painful. But it need not be made more painful.
- Culture comes to us first through our mothers' bodies.
- Later, it comes through food, rituals, and sex.
- We do choose whether or not to engage in these things. But we do not choose which of them will resonate with us.
- If we lose touch with the things that resonate with us, we begin to fade.
- It is not good to fade.
- The culture of freedom pretends to be chosen. It even demands it.
- But what other choice did most of us have?
- We continue it, so that we will not fade.

### - 6 -

- People are so often not on the same page.
- Are they in the same book?

### - 7 -

- Kant says that the only moral law is to allow each individual to express his or her autonomous will.
- But where do these wills come from?
- Surely from our bodies.
- Surely from our cultures.
- How else would individuals know what to want?
- I want to be an autonomous individual, like everyone else.

### - 8 -

- Moralities are enforced through punishment.
- We punish those who are not individual enough.
- But what about family?

### - 9 -

- Families make the same kind of noise.
- We need to be near those who make familiar noise, because otherwise we fade.
- A family can be made from autonomous individuals, but something is missing.
- What is missing is the recognition of similarity.

### - 10 -

- We are made similar by the absorption of culture.
- Does culture exist at the level of micro-organisms?
- In yogurt it does.
- Are we made similar by sharing yogurt?

### - 11 -

- This is just one example.
- We are certainly made similar through sex.

### - 12 -

- What if the yogurt goes bad?
- Will the reaction in my gut affect my will?
- Yes, it surely will.

### - 13 -

- Those who have better yogurt will have better bodies and minds.
- Perhaps this is usually better left unsaid.
- We don’t want to arouse the anger of those who have had bad yogurt, through no fault of their own.
- One cannot put new yogurt into old yogurt cups.

### - 14 -

- But what if we *do* put new yogurt into old yogurt cups?

### - 15 -

- The point of life is to blossom, and to thrive.
- To spread our influence, and to make that influence endure.
- The best way to make influence endure is to genuinely benefit others.

### - 16 -

- The culture of freedom has many benefits, but it does not leave much room for influencing others.
- So then what is life for?

### - 17 -

- Moral purity is not an end in itself.
- It is at best a means of increasing our capacity to benefit others.

### - 18 -

- Roman law promises power that can never exist for humans.
- It is the power of making a decree that is valid always and everywhere.
- Human laws are contingent.
- Thinkers in the early modern period began to notice this.
- They said that power derives from the consent of the governed.
- But this is only part of the story.
- No amount of voting can make men immortal, or less dependent on food.
- Power may be maintained by the consent of the governed, but it derives from nature.
- In particular, from biological processes.

### - 19 -

- I reject the idea that nature is ruthless.
- Humans are ruthless. Nature is very lazy. 
- Nature is only ruthless when threatened.
- If humans are often ruthless, it is only because they are often threatened.

### - 20 -

- I think we are in a dark age.
- The difference between a dark age and a light age is that nobody in the future will look to the dark age as an example.
- I cannot recommend looking to us as an example.
- We do not know what we are doing.

### - 21 -

- We must try to know what we are doing.
- How can we find an example?
- There have been light ages, but their examples blind us.
- We may not adjust well to their light.
- We must look for examples that meet us where we are.
- Or can we become such examples?

### - 22 -

- How can we become such examples?
- By returning to fundamentals.
- By encountering plants and animals.
- By gardening.

### - 23 -

- All good examples move carefully.
- This is a test of goodness.
- The thrill of annihilation is barbaric.
- Good examples are not barbaric.

### - 24 -

- Good examples cultivate society like a garden.
- They dislike weeds as much as barbarians.

### - 25 -

- Since the discovery of the New World, one of the dominant modes of power in Western Europe has been Giver of Gifts from Afar.
- Those with more foreign gifts have had more power.
- Perhaps we are stretched too thin, “like butter spread over too much bread.”
- We could make do with more butter or less bread.

### - 26 -

- This mode of power is even more prevalent in the New World itself.

### - 27 -

- The chief virtue in a liberal society is humility.
- One cannot know what another values.
- Are there simply too many values?

### - 28 -

- But are we to value liberalism? Or liberty? Or life and the pursuit of happiness?
- How should we treat those who do not value these things?
- Should we educate them? Punish them? Tolerate them?
- Each path has its advantages.

### - 29 -

- We should culture with them.
- We should adapt to them, and hope that they likewise adapt to us.
- We should evolve together.

### - 30 -

- But we should recognize some limitations.

### - 31 -

- Aristotle was wrong to project human reasoning onto the cosmos.
- The cosmos is not rational.
- Only humans are rational.
- Reasoning is a human activity.

### - 32 -

- Then, what is the cosmos?
- It is chaos. 
- But this cannot be. The cosmos is stable.
- Then it is a collection of balanced opposites.

### - 33 -

- The interplay of opposites, we call culture.
- It is well that these forces have a common ancestor.
- That is why they can harmonize.

### - 34 -

- Reasoning is one kind of culture. It is not unique to humans, though humans are skilled at it.
- Reasoning cannot transcend life.
- Reasoning depends on life.

### - 35 -

- For centuries, mystics have claimed that ultimate reality is unknowable.
- No doubt we will continue ignoring them.

### - 36 -

- Many humans believe that they have control over their lives.
- I doubt this, but the belief is important.
- Without it, we may not survive.

### - 37 -

- What does belief offer us?
- A shared cooperative framework.
- An understanding of which behaviors are permitted and which are punished.
- Without these, there could be no cities.

### - 38 -

- Aristotle’s folly, and ours, lies in seeking a universal belief.
- There can never be any such thing.
- Logic is in the mind, if we’re lucky.
- It can never be anywhere else.

### - 39 -

- Perhaps it would be better to call this Alexander’s folly.
- Belief spread by the sword.

### - 40 -

- There is a cooperative spirit in humans more magnificent than in any other animal.
- This is enabled by belief in a common cause.
- But whose cause?

### - 41 -

- The cultural marxists think they can do away with belief.
- How will they feel when we stop believing in their cause?

### - 42 -

- The meritocrats believe in ambition alone.
- Does this not uproot all belief?

### - 43 -

- The cause must be cooperative.
- It doesn’t matter whose it is.
- It also must sustain us.
- The cause cannot transcend life.
