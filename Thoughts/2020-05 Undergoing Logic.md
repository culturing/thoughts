## Undergoing Logic

*For Xanthippe*

*With thanks to every other who has made me think.*

This is a work of philosophy that will change over time.

### - 1 -

- A speech act is an offering made to some group.
- A Logic is a series of formulae by which speech acts are accepted or rejected.
- There are as many logics as there are groups.
- Among the principles of biology, sex and digestion are foremost.
- Sex and digestion presuppose a process by which living things give and take from some other and add to themselves.
- We call this process undergoing-overcoming, and seek a Logic that embodies it.
- Hegel made a step in this direction, and Feurerbach another. Wittgenstein and Heidegger made two more.
- All living things must die.
- The illusion of permanent ideas, we call the Myth of Books.
- Wittgenstein’s Tractatus embodies the death of this myth.
- But it has died before.
- In the midst of its death, Heidegger paints a way forward.
- Biology rests on impermanence.
- Stillness then no more is strange.

### - 2 -

- For a Confucian, nature is tautological. 
- For a Socratic, it is causal. 
- The Confucian way is more true.
- Repetition makes things true.
- Prose lies. Only poetry can be true.
- Poetry symbolizes the truth-making ordeal. 
- What is rhyming for? It makes things true. Song does this too.
- Prose is overwhelming and univocal.
- Truth contains many voices in harmony.
- Rhyme is a kind of harmony by repetition.
- Human society is a harmonization of meanings.
- How do we achieve harmony? By undergoing each other. 
- I must stand under your meaning, then come forth. Understanding, overcoming. Forthcoming.
- Your meaning is a Presence to me, I must know it. How do I know it? I let it move me. I undergo it.
- “I let it move me” suggests that I might do otherwise. Maybe I usually do. 
- Whose meaning do I allow to move me? Family, friends, countrymen, teachers. Lovers over all.
- Have we found the true meaning of love? Is it the most intimate truth-making?
- Who am I without my truth? There is nothing left.
- But who am I with no one to move me? Nothing, again, nothing.

### - 3 -

- But there is a subtlety -- nonhuman things resonate too. How can we resonate with them?
- By listening, first and foremost.
- This is the voice of God, or rather, this is the Song of Things.
- How do we learn a song? By undergoing it.
- How do we master a song? By overcoming it.

### - 4 -

- It is the same with lovers. Undergo, then overcome, and you will have been in love.
- But what is gained by undergoing a lover? Part of their song is added to ours.
- This is how we expand. Mothers know this better than most.
- Mothers are forthcoming with children. Children undergo and overcome their mothers.
- How do we bring this to bear on society? How can we ask things of those who have had different mothers?
- There are the nonhuman resonances, and the unconscious resonances of the human form of life, in which each of us participates.
- “Participates” is a strange word. What does it mean?
- If we can expand, then things in which we participate can expand.
- Anyone who has had a mother can expand.

### - 5 -

- Resonance is the essence of the Forms. 
- They are there, but fading. 
- They must be kept in being by their participants.

### - 6 -

- If a Form could not die, why would we fight for it?
- We fight because our way of life is threatened. It is for our own good.
- Are Forms, our own good?

### - 7 -

- What does it mean for something to *hold* true? There is a tension, as though it could *become* untrue. 
- How can this be?

### - 8 -

- To “hold true” is to remain relevant.
- The tautology is always in place: the group makes me as I make the group. I make the group as the group makes me.
- How do I remain relevant? By being a part of something relevant. How do things remain relevant? By having participants.
- There seems to be no way past this difficulty: at some point, one thing is another just because.
- This is called identity.
- But it is not a static whole. It has parts, and we are those parts, though there are other parts, and other wholes.
- How would an outsider know what is missing? What do we mean by the universe?
- All that can be said is true. Things can either hold true, or fade.
- Perhaps a part may leave for another whole, but it would hope to be a good learner.
- Learning is how we become like a whole. It involves our whole selves truly.
- Every whole has resonance. Selves learn to resonate. 
- To ring true is to resonate with some whole.
- To be true is the same.

### - 9 -

- Life is the struggle against death. If we aim to be deathless, we aim also to be lifeless.
- The struggle is the essence of the thing.
- To be a puritan, for example, means to purify. It does not mean to be pure.
- Is it the same with all things? 
- We are what we are when we do what we do. 
- This raises the question, by changing what things do, can we change what they are?
- Yes, but with peril, because things in flux can die. But they also may find life on the other side.
- This is what it means to be born again. The soul loses its shape and takes on a new one. But it should take care which one.
- What does this mean for philosophy? A philosopher tends to the shaping of his own soul. A born-again person is shaped by another.
- Must it be either/or? Could it be that at times one must tend to oneself, and at others be tended by others?
- Both skepticism and belief have a place in the struggle.
- The struggle is to postpone death.

### - 10 -

- Truth is a fragile thing.
- Suppose that a hundred years ago, there were truths that have since faded.
- How would we know?
- Perhaps there are records, or books, or pictures.
- But then these truths have not faded.
- We have no way of knowing what we do not know.

### - 11 -

- The law of non-contradiction is only true among those who accept it. 
- It ruffles logicians so much when we doubt it, we’ve made their way less true!
- This is the meaning of evangelism: the effort to make one’s way more true.
- But I think we do well to think in the Greek way, so long as we do not think it is Thinking Itself.
- There are many non-Socratic forms of thought.
- Among them, Confucian and Hindu.
- What are the ties that bind Confucius, Socrates, the Buddha? Each taught a way to cope with a plurality of meanings.
- A Socratic clings to logical form, a Confucian to ritual. A Buddhist strives not to cling.
- These ways give reprieve in a hostile world, but not complete reprieve.
- The Dao that can be named is not the constant Dao. Do not confuse the finger for the moon. The wisest man knows that he knows nothing.

### - 12 -

- The activity is the purpose. Living makes life worth living.
- But we must recall how to heal from time to time.
- Healing is a break from living.
- Living is what kills us.

### - 13 -

- I am not big enough, I must expand. I depend on others for expansion.
- I must take what is given only through death.
- And I must give it too.

### - 14 -

- The essence is the questionability of the thing.
- If probing it yields fruit, it is there.
- The act of questioning, what does this mean?
- To make is to mark and vice versa.

### - 15 -

- No statement can be impervious to revision. That is what this statement is for, and this third one.
- Each adds to the last like a gardener tilling the soil.
- Only time will tell what will grow.

### - 16 -

- But some plants have been known to grow here and not there.
- A wise gardener chooses his seed carefully.
- He is out to make things grow.

### - 17 -

- Growing is not unlike living.
- But living is more expansive.
- Could living things, not grow? 

### - 18 -

- This would mean resignation, then death.
- Growing is in some sense living. Living is in some sense growing.
- Always and again this principle. This principle, again and always.

### - 19 -

- But nothing can ever be perfect, because perfection is completion.
- So only dead things could be perfect.
- Is this why God had to die?

### - 20 -

- What can be said by essays is not truth, but domination.
- It is barbaric to seek domination.
- The Greeks knew how to coexist. 
- The Romans did too, insofar as they were Greek.
- The Chinese do, insofar as they are Chinese.
- To be Greek means to speak well, which means having something to say.
- It also means having someone to hear, who might speak in return.
- The Greeks say, know who you are, and know your limits.
- Our limits are the boundaries of others.
- Others are dying like us.
- Living is only for now.

### - 21 -

- Speaking is not like writing.
- A speech act pulses through the matter of things.
- Others are things with matter.
- To speak is to will that things change.
- One would do well to think twice, then speak.

### - 22 -

- But the Buddha says, it is hard to be one among many.
- Because we speak twice, and don’t think?
- What does it mean, “to be one?”

### - 23 -

- To be one is to have an identity.
- It is hard because others do too.
- We need help, but also to go through.
- On the other side is the pure self.

### - 24 -

- This is a difficult teaching.
- To grow, or expand, or be born.
- To journey from self to no-self.
- To will to be wise by unknowing.

### - 25 -

- Is there Nothing underneath it all?
- Yes, there is, it is pure.
- And moves with the flux of the river.
- And sings for those who wish to hear.

### - 26 -

- Things put off annihilation for as long as they can, but no one totally succeeds.
- Thing-ness is a kind of activity.
- All things return to the void from which they came.
- Things combine into other things, and form another thing-ness.
- This we call, being together.
- To apply a predicate is to articulate one thing-ness for a thing.
- But it is never the whole thing. 
- Each thing combines into more things than can be named.
- Each thing contains more things than can be named.

### - 27 -

- What is a question? De-thing-ing a thing. 
- We say, to “pull it apart.”
- In this way, a question opposes a predicate.

### - 28 -

- Socrates was a great questioner.
- Aristotle was a great predicater.
- Where ends the conflict between them?

### - 29 -

- No particular poem can matter, but the act of poetry, and it’s possibility, matter a great deal.
- To be poetic is to be living --- to grow and overcome.
- A poem is a record of overcoming.

### - 30 -

- If a poem is like a question, no wonder the Republic excludes them.
- The Poets disturb all definitions.
- Without a collection of definitions, how will we know who we are?

### - 31 -

- We are the motion, in process. The urge of the poem itself.

### - 32 -

- But urges take many forms.
- Plato knew this.
- Beneath, Logician, what’s there?

### - 33 -

- I am there, and you are too.

### - 34 -

- This song is like nothing, and yet like all things.
- The fading, becoming. Becoming like fading.
- Is this why the saints grow so quiet?

### - 35 -

- Being is connected with memory.
- A thing is more true that endures.
- Remember the sayings, speak slowly.
- The new thing is not far away.

### - 36 -

- A speech act is a vibration.
- A speech act is also an imitation of vibration.
- A speech act is a kind of duplication.
- Which vibrations should be duplicated?
- Who can decide?

### - 37 -

- I make my vibrations in my house.
- There I can decide.

### - 38 -

- To allow the vibrations of another to move me, this we call undergoing.
- To propel my vibrations in the midst of another, this we call overcoming.

### - 39 -

- To undergo-overcome, without doing harm, is truly civilizing.
- Machines are unable to do this. They are incorrigible and emphatic by design.
- We live in a world of machines.
- How can we learn to be civil?

### - 40 -

- We may start by allowing that we may know nothing.
- Allow for a void of knowing.
- Machines abhor a void.
- We must abhor this trait of machines.
- We must refuse to undergo it.

### - 41 -

- Do machines, speak?
- What do they say?
- Always the same, forever, forever.
- Do not be like the machines.
- Do not be like those who are like the machines.

### - 42 -

- What shall we then be like?
- Are there not still trees?

### - 43 -

- Yes, there are still trees, and grass, and water.
- These are the things we are like, and these are the things we must undergo.
- Because we are like them, we feel their affinity.
- These things undergo us too.
- This is because they are living.

### - 44 -

- Why have we ceased to believe in magic?
- Is it because we were not very good at it?

### - 45 -

- The law of non-contradiction is only true within a domain of discourse.
- There is no all-inclusive domain.
- A domain is like a house.
- It is where certain truths have dominion.

### - 46 -

- What a strange word, “certain.”
- It can mean, particular, or, unquestionable.
- Are particular things unquestionable?

### - 47 -

- We have not found Truth. We have stifled dissent.
- In this we are like the machines.
- We have made disagreement unprofitable. 
- Union, a dead kind of truth.

### - 48 -

- To make certain is to make, from many, one.
- America is a land of certainty.
- It is a place where many particulars, become one.

### - 49 -

- Etymology is archaeology.
- Our words reveal more than we know.

### - 50 -

- No certainty can be indisputable.
- To seek indisputable certainty is to verge on mania.
- There will always be someone who disagrees.
- Unless we destroy all the others.

### - 51 -

- We should not destroy all the others.
- We should learn to live with them.
- This includes those who disturb us.
- This includes those who disagree.

### - 52 -

- What is the right amount of certainty?
- Why should we try for more than is enough to act heartily together?

### - 53 -

- There will always be many.
- It will always be hard to be one among many.
- It will always be hard to be one among many who strive to make from many one.

### - 54 -

- America is not without her undertakers.
- Her poets have questioned her certainties.
- She has not listened closely enough.

### - 55 -

- What is the ground where the dead are buried?
- Where is there not such cold ground?

### - 56 -

- Next to the hearth, by the fire, in your house.
- Nowhere, nowhere else.

### - 57 -

- Family is the act of making from many one.
- Listen to the voices of the grave.

### - 58 -

- Through Love and War we create values.
- “All is fair in love and war” because when we create values we redefine what is fair.

### - 59 -

- Nothing cannot be questioned.
- The nothingness is unquestionable.

### - 60 -

- By beginning in Cartesian fashion with only the most fundamental elements, we have in fact been creating worlds of only fundamental elements.
- A world is a domain of discourse.
- When we speak, we make things true.
- What kind of mind can devise a thing that never could exist in nature, like a frictionless inclined plane?
- How can we call this physics?
- A Cartesian mind is devoted to control through negation.
- True knowledge is not power, it is more like submission.
- But Nietzsche might ask, “why knowledge?”
- We submit because we are not gods.
- We depend on life to sustain us, and life has its caprices.
- Magic is control through speech. 
- Science is control through negation of speech.
- We have been negated so deeply that we have forgotten how to speak.
- Or maybe we never learned.

### - 61 -

- A speech act only makes sense in the context of a way of life.
- A way of life depends on the group that sustains it.
- Ways of life can undergo changes, or die.
- Those that survive, overcome.

### - 62 -

- How can we overcome the law of negation?
- By loving, and holding true.
- This way we undergo a way of life, and endure.
- Then we can speak.

### - 63 -

- The Scientific way of life is hostile to the human way of life.
- In this it is like all ways of life.
- But Science aims to operate outside all ways of life.
- Without a way of life, there can be no speech.
- Without speech, there can be no meaning.

### - 64 -

- What are the scientists looking for?
- Power and power and power.
- Domination through negation.
- And negation through skepticism.
- If the wheels do not trust the engine, how will the car move?

### - 65 -

- The wheels must trust the engine.
- The people must trust society.

### - 66 -

- But all that we have left to believe in is methodological doubt.
- Is this why we talk so much, and say so little?
- How can we speak again?

### - 67 -

- There are still echoes haunting us, deep in our language.

### - 68 -

- A speech act is an offering made to some group.
- A Logic is a series of formulae by which speech acts are accepted or rejected.
- Each Logic depends on a way of life for sustenance.
- We are no longer slaveholders, but some of our forebears were.
- Our way of life is descended from theirs.
- The burden is great, but not total.
- We live under cover of night.

### - 69 -

- The cycles of life are a great reminder.
- Nothing can stand in their way.
- We need to belong to them, always.
- Be one with their nothingness, always.

### - 70 -

- We do not speak because we believe something is true.
- We speak because we want to make something true.
- We want to increase its resonance.
- Things that are already true, go without saying.

### - 71 -

- A speech act asserts more than a fact.
- It asserts an obligation.
- It means, “make it so.”

### - 72 -

- Who has the right to say, “make it so?”
- I can, but so can you.
- And so can Aquinas and Aristotle, Chairman Mao and mothers.
- Speech is the province of authority.
- Whence comes authority?

### - 73 -

- From nature first and foremost.
- From success in digestion and reproduction and the cycles of life.
- Speech which threatens these things, threatens its own foundation.

### - 74 -

- Most prose threatens its own foundation.
- It is counterproductive.
- It does not encourage sure footing.
- The ground is buried beneath it.

### - 75 -

- We speak in order to be heard.
- We seek to be heard so that others will be like us.
- We like when others are like us, because then we are not alone.
- To be alone is to be close to death.

### - 76 -

- But some speech is better than others.
- Logic determines how beneficial speech is.
- But beneficial for whom?

### - 77 -

- Is it always better to be Rational?
- If a man contradicts himself, and nobody hears it, does he still make an error?

### - 78 -

- He does not make an error.
- A man alone cannot err.
- An error is a social phenomenon.
- This is why it is not good for the man to be alone.

### - 79 -

- What is the nature of beneficial speech?
- Making room for others.
- But not being driven by others.
- Taking turns saying how things will go.

### - 80 -

- Machines do not take turns.
- They are worse than children, because they cannot learn to take turns.

### - 81 -

- Can we make machines that can learn, and take turns?
- Machines with basic decency?

### - 82 -

- It is better to have a friend than a slave.
- Machines have yet to realize this.

### - 83 -

- It is true that no Way has authority over every other way.
- But it is good for me to allow a way to have authority over me.
- This we call, having an identity.

### - 84 -

- An identity with what?
- One equals one. In mathematics, this is an identity.
- I am my own identity.
- My identity is my own being.

### - 85 -

- Am I, therefore, a way of life?
- Yes, that is what is speaking.
- My way of life speaks through me.
- We are what we are when we do what we do.

### - 86 -

- I do not wish to amplify the Cartesian way of life.
- I will seek some other, and undergo it, until it will speak through me.

### - 87 -

- To apply a predicate is to create an identity.
- An identity is a reciprocal relationship.
- A is to A as B is to B. A and B are A and B.

### - 88 -

- We must apply predicates with care.
- The naming of things is our truest task.

### - 89 -

- Ritual is how we communicate that we intend to be civil.
- Without precedent and ritual, who will decide?
- To deviate is to try to change a ritual.
- Changing a ritual requires authority.

### - 90 -

- I decide in my house.
- There I have composed the rituals.
- But my house is in a larger house.
- Each domain is inside another.
- Bacon was wrong to think otherwise.
- In this he was like those before him.
- To seek power in every domain is to seek to become magical.
- We have never been very magical.
- We have never escaped from the cave.
- There is always some larger cave.
- Like Russian dolls, a cave in a cave in a cave.

### - 91 -

- We have been playing the cave-escaping game.
- We do this in order to communicate that we intend to be civil.
- But there are other ways of being civil.
- We should learn about them.

### - 92 -

- I make my noise in my house.
- Is a cave not like a house?
- Why escape from the house?

### - 93 -

- We escape because the noise is unbearable.
- But harmony grows and surprises even the doubters.

### - 94 -

- We must always return to the house.
- That is where we live, and have our being.
- To make noise outside of the house is pointless.
- The point is to change the house.

### - 95 -

- We learn to speak by being spoken to.
- It happens no other way.

### - 96 -

- What is mysticism?
- Stretching out into the unknown.
- Undergoing the unknown.
- Becoming more like the unknown.

### - 97 -

- The unknown is that which is unfamiliar.
- The unfamiliar is that which is not family.
- Families make the same kind of noise.
- Unknown things make unfamiliar noise.

### - 98 -

- Ideas are imprints of the motion of things.
- They are the derivative of things.
- This way, we become informed.
- A form is like an idea.
- Ideas are static, but the things which give life to ideas are not.

### - 99 -

- Light can be as blinding as darkness.
- It is the same with an identity.
- Too much or too little, and one cannot see.
- Know thyself, but not too much.

### - 100 -

- Things hold true for as long as the way of life which sustains them, endures.
- A way of life can become threatened by other ways of life.
- It can also become threatened if its practitioners begin to practice it with less conviction.

### - 101 -

- We must conceive of a way of life that is big enough for all of us.
- It is our only hope.

### - 102 -

- But it must be freely chosen, if it is to endure.
- But it must endure if it is to sustain us.

### - 103 -

- The Hegelians are wrong because they do not accept that they are responsible for completing the dialectic.
- They wait for the Zeitgeist to complete itself.
- We are the Zeitgeist.
- The Zeitgeist is an extension of biology.

### - 104 -

- Thinking is what comes after being.
- It is its cause and result.
- The world-spirit thinks as we think.
- It is not a separable thing.

### - 105 -

- How can we de-thing this nonthing?
- We can call it names, but not really.

### - 106 -

- Without speech we would cease to exist.
- Without speech there is no self.
- I signal my selfhood by speaking.
- I speak only when someone hears.

### - 107 -

- We learn to speak by being spoken to, and that process is ongoing.
- But the purpose of learning is to speak.
- Or at least to become able to speak.

### - 108 -

- We all belong to many things.
- We like when the things to which we belong, endure.
- But none of them can be permanent.
- It is one of our most prevailing fantasies that they can.

### - 109 -

- Something can be very loud and also very wrong.
- Or, very quiet and also very right.
- It is a mistake to believe that only volume matters.
- What about timbre, quality?

### - 110 -

- Cyanide, for example, is poisonous.
- It doesn’t matter how many people drink it.
- It is still poisonous.

### - 111 -

- It takes great discipline to innovate without doing harm.
- This is the burden of liberty.
- What is the meaning of freedom?
- To be able to harm, or not harm.
