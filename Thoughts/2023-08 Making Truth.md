Making Truth
August 2023

### - 1 -

- Humans are finite creatures in a largely unknowable world.
- Science is an effort to reach out into an unpenetrable world.
- Science, as a striving for total knowledge, is doomed to fail.
- Our penetration never reaches further than the ends of our hands.

### - 2 -

- How far is man from truth? An infinite distance?
- How could we live without definition?
- Truth is manmade, but truth-making is divine.
- The end is the beginning made new.

### - 3 -

- A positive vision can make men move.
- Negation is for altering course.
- Motion itself is a great mystery.
- But why must it have a single cause?

### - 4 -

- Things move for a variety of reasons.
- There is no one, solitary ground.
- Humans move due to ambition.
- Ambition to make homes and thrive.

### - 5 -

- What is the meaning of struggle?
- Struggle proves differences of perspective.
- Without such differences, there would be no struggle.
- Can any one opinion be *correct*?

### - 6 -

- The Romans prioritized correctness.
- Caesar's opinion was always correct.
- This was a way of repressing struggle.
- Repression, the tool of empire.

### - 7 -

- The Greeks knew better.
- Knowing is never a matter of correctness.
- Knowing is a matter of discovery.
- A Greek could discover the errors of Caesar.

### - 8 -

- The English prioritize utility.
- The Americans are English in the wilderness.
- American utility means order from chaos (pragma).
- English utility means liberty from too much order.

### - 9 -

- Humans are always in an environment
- Truth is a way of coping with that environment
- Too little, and there is chaos
- Too much, and there is oppression

### - 10 -

- The most difficult task is to judge which truths shall be preserved
- Some truths are always bad, others become bad over time
- All truths expire one day
- An expired truth no longer aligns with the environment of its people

### - 11 -

- There are many ways to respond to expired truths
- The most effective is violence, but it is also the most brutal and most likely to inspire revenge.
- Reasoning is more durable, but harder to effect
- Political and economic coercion is the middle way

### - 12 -

- But who is to decide which truths are expired?
- And how shall we decide whom is to decide?
- And what if we do not all agree?
- And what if we disagree vehemently?

### - 13 -

- Every group much know which behaviors are permitted and which are punished, but these categories are fluid.
- Humans must interact
- These interactions must be regulated by rules, which can be called rituals
- Rituals adapt over time. This is called history

### - 14 -

- Why must there be rituals? Because there must be trust.
- Why must there be trust? So that we can work together.
- Why must we work together? So that we survive.
- Why must we survive? Because we are alive.

### - 15 -

- History is the origin of truths.
- We adapt our rituals to changing circumstances.
- Their forms become our truths.
- But the process is ongoing...

### - 16 -

- Philosophers tend to this process
- They are its caretakers.
- Sophia names insight into the changing of the gods.
- This is what philosophers love

### - 17 -

- Chun-tzse also tend to this process.
- They have a looser grip.
- They live *within* the process.
- They are not tyrants over it.

### - 18 -

- I want to break the cycle of tyranny
- If we fight tyranny with tyranny, we will always get more tyranny
- But how can else we fight tyranny?
- With harmony?

### - 19 -

- Is it naive to fight tyranny with harmony?
- Or is it the only way?
- Not harmony only with each other.
- Harmony with our status as historical beings.

### - 20 -

- Tyranny is always self-tyranny
- Libido dominandi, as Augustine said.
- But Christianity is cosmic tyranny
- The way is to make peace with change

### - 21 -

- But love-of-change is a new kind of tyranny
- It misses the point, like so many times before
- The point is to break out of tyranny
- Can it be done? Can it be done?

### - 22 -

- The place to begin is with an example
- But who can show us? The Chun-tzse?
- If not them, then who?
- We have not succeeded on our own.

### - 23 -

- We must learn how to receive an example
- We must learn how to learn
- The water is only waist-deep.
- A grown man can wade through the current.

### - 24 -

- But not if he has never been shown.
- He must overcome his fear
- And he must have good company.
- Then he shall master the stream.
