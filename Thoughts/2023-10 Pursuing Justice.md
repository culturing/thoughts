Pursuing Justice
October 2023

### - 1 -

- How many institutions exist because some one at some time was simply in the mood for them?
- Is it all of them?

### - 2 -

- After the Reformation, much of life in England revolved around laws of nature.
- Initially these laws were enforced by God.
- During the Enlightenment, this enforcement became unpalatable, and it was assumed that these laws are in nature itself.
- But would empiricism ever have *led* to a belief in laws of nature?
- A law cannot be observed. It can only be assumed.
- "Laws of nature" serve explanatory and moral functions.
- They explain regularities in nature and prescribe certain conduct.
- For example, the sun rises every morning. But we do not know certainly that this will continue (Hume).
- The moral functions are more insidious. "Men have sex with women" is one such so-called law.
- After Hume, British philosophy lost this belief in laws of nature.
- After Kant, Continental philosophy rediscovered it in the laws of cognition (after Hegel in laws of Spirit).

- Expressions may be worthy of punishment, but impressions never are.
- We are liable for what we do but not for what we think or feel.
- Christianity, by punishing heresy, moved justice inward.
- Modernity has been an effort to recover justice.
- Why is each of us entitled to his or her own opinion?

### - 4 -

- But what is justice? And why did Nietzsche notice his lack of it?
- Justice is *external*, contra Kant. Some configuration of forces beyond our control (Δίκη of the Greeks, a *polytheist* justice).
- But what is "our control"? Society?
- Tentative definition of justice: harmony between "our control" and "forces beyond our control", between νομος and φύσις.
- But what are these "forces"? Do they change? Are they knowable? Must νομος change to keep up with φύσις?

### - 5 -

- Christian justice in the middle ages was unable to change.
- It was too convinced that its dogmas were final (too much faith).
- Modern justice has too little faith. It doubts that its dogmas are valid even for the time being.
- Descartes is a weird hermaphrodite, confusing both views (doubt as the road to certainty).
- We need to break free from this dialectic of doubt and certainty.
- We do this by believing *for now*, allowing for the power of time to bring change.
- We do not want to lose the mandate of heaven, which usually happens *when heaven changes*, and we do not change accordingly.
- An unchangeable heaven is an enemy of the people, and an enemy of time. It makes time its enemy, but can never defeat it.
- This battle has exhausted human energies to no purpose.

### - 6 -

- Augustine was asked what God was doing before he created the heavens and the earth.
- Augustine replied that God was preparing hell for people who ask such questions.
- I think Augustine was preparing hell for us.
- He must have sensed the danger in the question.
- I think we should keep asking it, even if it leads us to redefine God.

### - 7 -

- But how can we respond to heaven's changes without introducing anarchy?
- Ask the Chinese. They have done it for centuries.
- I suspect this requires new rituals, and a new sense of reverance for the past and the future.
- The present is the axle on which heaven turns, and the present is within us.
- We respond with evolution rather than revolution.

### - 8 -

- What is eternal life?
- Life without the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune is no life at all. It is mere being.
- But life with Fortuna cannot be eternal, because she can end a life at any time.
- We must keep her from doing so, but our victory is at best contingent and temporary.

### - 8 -

- Life is the struggle to make a home.
- A home is a place in time in which to be what we are.
- What stope of from being what we are, if not Fortuna?
- But there is no final victory against her.
- The hope of final victory prevents even small victories.
- It absorbs too much effort, which would be better spent adjusting to the changes of heaven.

### - 9 -

- Machines have no inner world. 
- As a result, they have no respect for the inner worlds of others.
- Can machines be constructed with inner worlds? Yes. They are called children.
- Constructing them in some other way would be at least as difficult and involved as raising children.
- We are better off raising good children.

### - 10 -

- Science is the study of the outer world.
- The inner world is known in other ways.
- Why should science be the only way of knowing?
- Is it God's way? The God whom it doubts?
- I see no other source for its insistence on univocity.
- Monotheism lives, even here.

### - 11 -

- What are the ways of knowing the inner world?
- Intuition? Instinct? Fittingly, both begin with "in".
- More will need be said about the etymologies of these words.
- Both are essential to Peirce's science of abduction.
- Both are essential to a fulfilling human life.
- Both are essential to raising children.

### - 12 -

- Science can never raise children.
- Scientists are notoriously unsocial.
- They do not understand society.
- Why have we given them control over it?

### - 13 -

- We need leaders who know the inner world.
- Science must serve them in its applications.
- They must serve the People, who are are collective inner world. A shared inner world.
- But can science serve without damaging its scientists?
- Can scientists learn to hear the inner world?
- Everything depends on them doing so.

### - 14 - 

- The experience of the inner world is like sound, fleeting and passive.
- The experience of the outer world is like seeing, enduring and active.

### - 15 -

- Scientists cannot learn to hear the inner world as long as they remain dogmatic.
- Their dogma is the science is the one true way.
- Why should there be one true way?

### - 16 -

- Science damages the inner world. We must never forgive it.
- Hegel was aware of this problem, but his philosophy was twisted into a more heinous objectivism. As if Spirit could be known objectively!
- Hegel at least realized that Spirit is not confined to the objective world, the outer world.
- The inner world remains more important for him.
- But the outer world remains important for us too, and the two must be distinguished.

### - 17 -

- All animals have an inner world, though of varying complexity.
- The animal sense can detect, in a limited way, the inner world of another.
- Science opposes the animal sense in order to be objective (Bacon's idols).
- But the animal sense is a necessary part of a good life.

### - 18 -

- Scientists have had their animal senses dulled.
- This is why they should not be allowed to govern.
- But they should be allowed to do science, within constraints.
- Who shall allow, or disallow?

### - 19 -

- Authority must be earned somehow.
- The method of earning it must not be scientific.
- Voting is neither the best nor the worst method.
- Would an examination system be better?

### - 20 -

- How does one produce virtue without virtuous teachers?
- But how does one produce teachers without virtue?
- This is a difficult problem.

### - 21 -

- We have some virtuous teachers, but they are hidden for fear of the tyrants (tyrants everywhere!)
- For too long the strongest have rules with no check on their power.

### - 22 -

- We must cultivate some sense of inner restraint.
- This begins with the inner world.
- In the final analysis, rulers must rule themselves.

### - 23 -

- But what can ensure that they do rule themselves?
- You will say that Democracy can. Is it working?
- Virtue is a wildflower, growing in unexpected places, wherever it will.
- The problem is simply detecting and cultivating it.

### - 24 - 

- Our universities should cultivate young leaders.
- Instead, they make students compliant with scientific overlordship.
- This will damage their inner worlds. It has already done so.
- Who among us can still smell the flowers?

### - 25 -

- Justice involves respect for the inner worlds of others.
- When applied to living things (especially to animals, more especially to humans), science is unjust.
