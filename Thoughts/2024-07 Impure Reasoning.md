Impure Reasoning
June 2024

### - 1 -

- Human cognition is as varied as the flora and fauna of the earth.
- Indeed, it is adapted to them.

### - 2 -

- What use are Kant's categories?
- As if there are only 3^4 kinds of thinking!
- And all of it according to Kant's schema!

### - 3 -

- Reason must find a new kind of rigor.
- Not *imitatio Dei*, but accommodating change.
- Things change. We think to keep up.
- Whatever created the universe is enemy as well as friend.
- We reason to tell them apart, to choose resistance or encouragement.
- But we must know what is good for us.

### - 4 -

- What are we? Crazy angels, like Emerson said?
- Or reasoning apes, as many now say?
- Or is man a special case?

### - 5 -

- In what sense is human reason different?
- Many animals communicate and cooperate. Many plan ahead.
- We tell stories that govern and define our conduct.
- We perform rituals to honor these stories.
- We labor effectively, freeing some of us to think full time.
- But the thinkers are obligated to serve the hand that feeds them.
- None can escape from this duty.
- The Romans tried, and thus Rome fell.
- In the meantime they created the illusion of transcendence.
- This illusion still causes us suffering.

### - 6 -

- Man is earth-bound, that much is now clear.
- But his ways of engaging with earth are remarkable.
- Nevertheless, uprooted he withers.
- We seek wealth in order to bless others.
- A hungry man has little dignity.

### - 7 -

- When two or more people are together, they synchronize.
- If they synchronize often, it changes them.
- Do we also synchronize with plants, animals, even tools?

### - 8 -

- The danger of electronics is that we become like them.
- Repetitive, dull, unsurprising, rigid, dead.
- Most likely synchrony occurs through electrical signals.
- (Our brains and nervous systems are electrical).
- (Electrical fields act at a distance).
- If so, synchrony with electrical tools should trouble us.
- Especially when these tools take the place of human synchrony.

### - 9 -

- We need each other.
- Not only in a pragmatic sense, but at a physiological level.
- No man is complete without his tribe.
- No man is whole without others.
- Do electrical tools prevent us from synchronizing?
- Do they deaden our capacity for synchrony?
- If so, what shall we do, now that these tools are everywhere?

### - 10 -

- These are clich√©s, but solutions remain elusive.
- Perhaps it is more than a practical problem.
- Perhaps it is more than a political problem.
- Perhaps it is a philosophical problem.
- Do we *prefer* dullness? Do we *like* repetition?

### - 11 -

- Kant inverted the syllogism, making the major premise the goal.
- He made the beginning into the end and *vice versa*.
- But it is an end (the "unconditioned") that can never be reached.
- Thus modern alienation.

### - 12 -

- We begin with major premises not because they are indubitable.
- We begin with major premises because *we have been socialized into them.*
- They represent our synchronization with others in our tribe.
- This is why Aristotle says that the polis is *prior* to the individual.
- Our premises come to us first through synchrony with others.
- This is also true of Kant's premise.
- His desire for the unconditioned was learned, and taught.
- But many think it is *how things really are*.

### - 13 -

- How are things, really?
- We do not even know whether we can know.

### - 14 -

- The transcendental habit has got to go.
- Transcendence excises us from others and therefore from premises.
- Without premises, reason is useless.
- This is very different from Kant's critique.
- He internalizes space and time and all of metaphysics.
- Time at least is external, because it can be shared.
- But it is not a property of some imaginary "unconditioned."
- Why did Kant insist that morality depends on belief in some unconditioned?
- Force of habit? Cultural prejudice? 
- Synchrony caused by shared time and space?

### - 15 -

- We like the repetitive dullness of electronics because they remind us of the unconditioned that we have been taught to crave.
- When we lose this craving, we will be free to build a better world.

### - 16 -

- But not a perfect world.
- That would be unconditioned.
- A world where imperfection is permitted.
- A world of impure reason.
- A world where we live *together* and value our social bonds above most else.
- A world of local synchrony.

### - 17 -

- This world may have room for electrical tools.
- But it will not be enslavable by them.
- And it will have definite limits.
