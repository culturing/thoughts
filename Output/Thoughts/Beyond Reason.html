<h3>- 1 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Philosophy begins with self-doubt, but it does not end with self-certainty. It does not end at all.</li>
<li>Answers contain new questions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 2 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>At some point, one must stop being kind. What is that point?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 3 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>According to the Greeks, the gods want us to think.</li>
<li>According to the Romans, the gods want us to obey.</li>
<li>According to the Jews, God wants us to trust.</li>
<li>Can all of these be true? Can none of them be true?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 4 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Philosophy does not solve problems. It only notices them.</li>
<li>Problems are solved by practical action.</li>
<li>Rarely, the notices of philosophy are heeded and the people prosper.</li>
<li>More often, a particular philosophy is institutionalized, and the people suffer under its oppression.</li>
<li>We must keep the living tree and not just its fruit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 5 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Aquinas is supposed to have asked, "What is God?"</li>
<li>Hegel's answer was that God is self-negating negation.</li>
<li>Hegel criticizes Leibniz for being dogmatic, but Hegel has not fully freed himself from Christian dogma either.</li>
<li>He assumes that features found in human rationality must therefore be features of the cosmos.</li>
<li>Dialectic occurs in the minds of men, and only there.</li>
<li>But it is important that it does occur there.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 6 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ancient religion was less literal than modern religion.</li>
<li>Religion is a line in the sand saying "cross and become my enemy."</li>
<li>There is no reason why religion must involve superhuman beings.</li>
<li>It involves an understanding between groups of people.</li>
<li>Belief in a superhuman guardian is infantilizing. It does not produce strong people.</li>
<li>How can we produce strong people?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 7 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Socrates asked, "Why have you not concerned yourself with the details?"</li>
<li>Confucius answered, "I am only a man. Can I consider all details?"</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 8 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Strength begins with humility, with some insight into the vast panoply of things unknown.</li>
<li>Not to understand them, but to understand the limits of our understanding.</li>
<li>Only with this understanding can we acquire appropriate fears.</li>
<li>The fear of the unknown is the essential motivation. It is the impetus to acquire strength.</li>
<li>Nothing is taken care of. Everything must be thought through.</li>
<li>This is the attitude of the Chun-tzse or a Greek Philosopher.</li>
<li>But not everything <em>can</em> be thought through, because humans have limits. Therefore, we must prioritize.</li>
<li>But how can we order our priorities?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 9 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Confucius says that social harmony should come before food.</li>
<li>Is this still believable? Was it ever believable?</li>
<li>Perhaps in a time of warring states, this is believable.</li>
<li>But we live in a time of too many social demands.</li>
<li>Are they simply the wrong demands?</li>
<li>Can we imagine a social order more valuable than food?</li>
<li>One with no otherworldly beyond?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 10 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>It is often asked, "if everyone jumped off a bridge, would you join them?"</li>
<li>The point is that groups should not always be trusted.</li>
<li>But I think the most human answer is "yes."</li>
<li>It can be quite moving.</li>
<li>In "Shoah," a Polish Jew tells a story about working in a Nazi camp.</li>
<li>One day a trainload of Poles arrived and were sent to be gassed.</li>
<li>He heard them singing the Polish national anthem and, weeping, threw down his broom and went in to join them.</li>
<li>They told him, "No! What are you doing? You must live to tell the world about what has happened here."</li>
<li>Is this not human? This desire to join the others even in death...what could be more human?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 11 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Religion is also a way in which we clean ourselves in preparation for sex. </li>
<li>But what if the soap is dirty?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 12 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Big businesses are the greatest threat to community that the world has ever known.</li>
<li>They cultivate predator/prey relationships.</li>
<li>They commodify and objectify humans.</li>
<li>How could we not imitate big businesses who do these things?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 13 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The human spirit cannot be measured objectively or evaluated.</li>
<li>It must be lived before it can be understood.</li>
<li>But markets are predicated on valuations.</li>
<li>What is the value of friendship?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 14 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We want an authority that places spiritual things on par with material things.</li>
<li>It must not ignore either.</li>
<li>It must have an elastic intelligence, to oscillate between these very different considerations.</li>
<li>It cannot objectify the spirit nor spiritualize the material.</li>
<li>It must understand both as parts of one whole.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 15 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Analytical and Continental schools of philosophy correspond roughly to material and spiritual.</li>
<li>The Continental school is older, beginning with Hegel. The Analytical school is a reaction against Hegel.</li>
<li>Hegel was too spiritual. His followers neglect objective analysis. </li>
<li>But he did recognize that Reason lives within each individual.</li>
<li>It cannot be imposed from without (as Frederick the Great attempted) and still remain reason.</li>
<li>The Analytical school is too anti-spiritual, as if sensing a danger in Hegel.</li>
<li>Wittgenstein is a rebel, poking holes in Analytical hyper-objectivism.</li>
<li>The conflict between these schools animated the world wars of the 20th Century.</li>
<li>Both would do well to ask whether the cosmos is really rationally ordered.</li>
<li>The conflict depends on differing understandings of the nature of reason.</li>
<li>But both insist that the universe is governed by reason.</li>
<li>If the universe is not so governed, the conflict becomes merely a matter of taste.</li>
<li>Let us hold a final dirge for cosmic reason. Our children will thank us.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 16 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But what can fill God's shoes?</li>
<li>Surely not us, given what we are.</li>
<li>Maybe new gods?</li>
<li>But what is a god?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 17 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>A god is a justification for conduct.</li>
<li>Which conduct shall we justify?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 18 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Preferably not consumerism.</li>
<li>Preferably not Marxism either, or any form of Hegelian dialecticism.</li>
<li>Not Analytical hyper-rationality either.</li>
<li>Probably not anything grounded in philosophy at all.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 19 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Philosophy is a critique of the gods and, by extension, of conduct.</li>
<li>It can never erect new gods, except maybe the demon god of absolute spirit.</li>
<li>Philosophy is an occasional practice for almost everyone.</li>
<li>It is only a way of life for very few. </li>
<li>These few are characterized by self-doubt.</li>
<li>But the religious life of the many should be more certain and clear. They themselves desire this.</li>
<li>Of what should it be certain? It depends...</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 20 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>America is a strange place, or a strange collection of places.</li>
<li>It has at least 50 living religions. Some have said it has 300 million gods.</li>
<li>Perhaps we could do better with slightly fewer, with more cohesion.</li>
<li>But we are brought together by frequent emergencies.</li>
<li>Then we disperse, after crisis is averted, back to our household gods.</li>
<li>Without a doubt, the many consider this cycle holy, as well they should.</li>
<li>But some of us still doubt - can we do better? Can <em>we</em>?</li>
<li>This cycle of benign neglect and coming together may be our true religion.</li>
<li>At least, it is the best we can do, here and now.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 21 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But a danger lurks that emergencies will be manufactured in order to bring us together.</li>
<li>This has happened before.</li>
<li>But somehow it never takes hold once the crisis is over.</li>
<li>What would we have to learn in order to remain in close contact with each other in the absence of an emergency?</li>
<li>Confucian humaneness? Self-control?</li>
<li>Can America learn these things and still be America?</li>
<li>Do we have any choice? Will China influence us, like it or not?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 22 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Without self-restraint, there will always be friction between persons.</li>
<li>With self-restraint, there may be slightly less friction.</li>
<li>There will also be less freedom, but this is a trade worth considering.</li>
