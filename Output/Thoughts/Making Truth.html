                <h2>Making Truth</h2>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>August 2023</small></small></em></p>

<h3>- 1 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Humans are finite creatures in a largely unknowable world.</li>
<li>Science is an effort to reach out into an unpenetrable world.</li>
<li>Science, as a striving for total knowledge, is doomed to fail.</li>
<li>Our penetration never reaches further than the ends of our hands.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 2 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>How far is man from truth? An infinite distance?</li>
<li>How could we live without definition?</li>
<li>Truth is manmade, but truth-making is divine.</li>
<li>The end is the beginning made new.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 3 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>A positive vision can make men move.</li>
<li>Negation is for altering course.</li>
<li>Motion itself is a great mystery.</li>
<li>But why must it have a single cause?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 4 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Things move for a variety of reasons.</li>
<li>There is no one, solitary ground.</li>
<li>Humans move due to ambition.</li>
<li>Ambition to make homes and thrive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 5 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is the meaning of struggle?</li>
<li>Struggle proves differences of perspective.</li>
<li>Without such differences, there would be no struggle.</li>
<li>Can any one opinion be <em>correct</em>?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 6 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Romans prioritized correctness.</li>
<li>Caesar's opinion was always correct.</li>
<li>This was a way of repressing struggle.</li>
<li>Repression, the tool of empire.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 7 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Greeks knew better.</li>
<li>Knowing is never a matter of correctness.</li>
<li>Knowing is a matter of discovery.</li>
<li>A Greek could discover the errors of Caesar.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 8 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The English prioritize utility.</li>
<li>The Americans are English in the wilderness.</li>
<li>American utility means order from chaos (pragma).</li>
<li>English utility means liberty from too much order.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 9 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Humans are always in an environment</li>
<li>Truth is a way of coping with that environment</li>
<li>Too little, and there is chaos</li>
<li>Too much, and there is opporession</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 10 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The most difficult task is to judge which truths shall be preserved</li>
<li>Some truths are always bad, others become bad over time</li>
<li>All truths expire one day</li>
<li>An expired truth no longer aligns with the environment of its people</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 11 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>There are many ways to respond to expired truths</li>
<li>The most effective is violence, but it is also the most brutal and most likely to inspire revenge.</li>
<li>Reasoning is more durable, but harder to effect</li>
<li>Political and economic coercion is the middle way</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 12 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But who is to decide which truths are expired?</li>
<li>And how shall we decide whom is to decide?</li>
<li>And what if we do not all agree?</li>
<li>And what if we disagree vehemently?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 13 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Every group much know which behaviors are permitted and which are punished, but these categories are fluid.</li>
<li>Humans must interact</li>
<li>These interactions must be regulated by rules, which can be called rituals</li>
<li>Rituals adapt over time. This is called history</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 14 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Why must there be rituals? Because there must be trust.</li>
<li>Why must there be trust? So that we can work together.</li>
<li>Why must we work together? So that we survive.</li>
<li>Why must we survive? Because we are alive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 15 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>History is the origin of truths.</li>
<li>We adapt our rituals to changing circumstances.</li>
<li>Their forms become our truths.</li>
<li>But the process is ongoing...</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 16 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Philosophers tend to this process</li>
<li>They are its caretakers.</li>
<li>Sophia names insight into the changing of the gods.</li>
<li>This is what philosophers love</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 17 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Chun-tzse also tend to this process.</li>
<li>They have a looser grip.</li>
<li>They live <em>within</em> the process.</li>
<li>They are not tyrants over it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 18 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>I want to break the cycle of tyranny</li>
<li>If we fight tyranny with tyranny, we will always get more tyranny</li>
<li>But how can else we fight tyranny?</li>
<li>With harmony?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 19 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Is it naive to fight tyranny with harmony?</li>
<li>Or is it the only way?</li>
<li>Not harmony only with each other.</li>
<li>Harmony with our status as historical beings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 20 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Tyranny is always self-tyranny</li>
<li>Libido dominandi, as Augustine said.</li>
<li>But Christianity is cosmic tyranny</li>
<li>The way is to make peace with change</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 21 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But love-of-change is a new kind of tyranny</li>
<li>It misses the point, like so many times before</li>
<li>The point is to break out of tyranny</li>
<li>Can it be done? Can it be done?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 22 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The place to begin is with an example</li>
<li>But who can show us? The Chun-tzse?</li>
<li>If not them, then who?</li>
<li>We have not succeeded on our own.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 23 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We must learn how to receive an example</li>
<li>We must learn how to learn</li>
<li>The water is only waist-deep.</li>
<li>A grown man can wade through the current.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 24 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But not if he has never been shown.</li>
<li>He must overcome his fear</li>
<li>And he must have good company.</li>
<li>Then he shall master the stream.</li>
</ul>
