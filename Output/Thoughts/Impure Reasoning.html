                <h2>Impure Reasoning</h2>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>June 2024</small></small></em></p>

<h3>- 1 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Human cognition is as varied as the flora and fauna of the earth.</li>
<li>Indeed, it is adapted to them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 2 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What use are Kant's categories?</li>
<li>As if there are only 3^4 kinds of thinking!</li>
<li>And all of it according to Kant's schema!</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 3 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Reason must find a new kind of rigor.</li>
<li>Not <em>imitatio Dei</em>, but accommodating change.</li>
<li>Things change. We think to keep up.</li>
<li>Whatever created the universe is enemy as well as friend.</li>
<li>We reason to tell them apart, to choose resistance or encouragement.</li>
<li>But we must know what is good for us.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 4 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What are we? Crazy angels, like Emerson said?</li>
<li>Or reasoning apes, as many now say?</li>
<li>Or is man a special case?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 5 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>In what sense is human reason different?</li>
<li>Many animals communicate and cooperate. Many plan ahead.</li>
<li>We tell stories that govern and define our conduct.</li>
<li>We perform rituals to honor these stories.</li>
<li>We labor effectively, freeing some of us to think full time.</li>
<li>But the thinkers are obligated to serve the hand that feeds them.</li>
<li>None can escape from this duty.</li>
<li>The Romans tried, and thus Rome fell.</li>
<li>In the meantime they created the illusion of transcendence.</li>
<li>This illusion still causes us suffering.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 6 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Man is earth-bound, that much is now clear.</li>
<li>But his ways of engaging with earth are remarkable.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, uprooted he withers.</li>
<li>We seek wealth in order to bless others.</li>
<li>A hungry man has little dignity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 7 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>When two or more people are together, they synchronize.</li>
<li>If they synchronize often, it changes them.</li>
<li>Do we also synchronize with plants, animals, even tools?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 8 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The danger of electronics is that we become like them.</li>
<li>Repetitive, dull, unsurprising, rigid, dead.</li>
<li>Most likely synchrony occurs through electrical signals.</li>
<li>(Our brains and nervous systems are electrical).</li>
<li>(Electrical fields act at a distance).</li>
<li>If so, synchrony with electrical tools should trouble us.</li>
<li>Especially when these tools take the place of human synchrony.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 9 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We need each other.</li>
<li>Not only in a pragmatic sense, but at a physiological level.</li>
<li>No man is complete without his tribe.</li>
<li>No man is whole without others.</li>
<li>Do electrical tools prevent us from synchronizing?</li>
<li>Do they deaden our capacity for synchrony?</li>
<li>If so, what shall we do, now that these tools are everywhere?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 10 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>These are clich√©s, but solutions remain elusive.</li>
<li>Perhaps it is more than a practical problem.</li>
<li>Perhaps it is more than a political problem.</li>
<li>Perhaps it is a philosophical problem.</li>
<li>Do we <em>prefer</em> dullness? Do we <em>like</em> repetition?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 11 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Kant inverted the syllogism, making the major premise the goal.</li>
<li>He made the beginning into the end and <em>vice versa</em>.</li>
<li>But it is an end (the "unconditioned") that can never be reached.</li>
<li>Thus modern alienation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 12 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We begin with major premises not because they are indubitable.</li>
<li>We begin with major premises because <em>we have been socialized into them.</em></li>
<li>They represent our synchronization with others in our tribe.</li>
<li>This is why Aristotle says that the polis is <em>prior</em> to the individual.</li>
<li>Our premises come to us first through synchrony with others.</li>
<li>This is also true of Kant's premise.</li>
<li>His desire for the unconditioned was learned, and taught.</li>
<li>But many think it is <em>how things really are</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 13 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>How are things, really?</li>
<li>We do not even know whether we can know.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 14 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The transcendental habit has got to go.</li>
<li>Transcendence excises us from others and therefore from premises.</li>
<li>Without premises, reason is useless.</li>
<li>This is very different from Kant's critique.</li>
<li>He internalizes space and time and all of metaphysics.</li>
<li>Time at least is external, because it can be shared.</li>
<li>But it is not a property of some imaginary "unconditioned."</li>
<li>Why did Kant insist that morality depends on belief in some unconditioned?</li>
<li>Force of habit? Cultural prejudice? </li>
<li>Synchrony caused by shared time and space?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 15 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We like the repetitive dullness of electronics because they remind us of the unconditioned that we have been taught to crave.</li>
<li>When we lose this craving, we will be free to build a better world.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 16 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But not a perfect world.</li>
<li>That would be unconditioned.</li>
<li>A world where imperfection is permitted.</li>
<li>A world of impure reason.</li>
<li>A world where we live <em>together</em> and value our social bonds above most else.</li>
<li>A world of local synchrony.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 17 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>This world may have room for electrical tools.</li>
<li>But it will not be enslavable by them.</li>
<li>And it will have definite limits.</li>
</ul>
