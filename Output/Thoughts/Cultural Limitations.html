                <h2>Cultural Limitations</h2>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>June 2021</small></small></em></p>

<p><em>For the Lady of Christ’s</em></p>

<p>“Something completely clean can also be completely sterile” -  <em>Nixon, private memorandum, 1972</em></p>

<h3>- 1 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>A culture is a set of predispositions, habits, and rituals shared by a group of people.</li>
<li>It is also a group of live bacteria in foods such as yogurt.</li>
<li>These definitions have much in common.</li>
<li>Our cultures come to us first through our mothers’ bodies.</li>
<li>But there are many mothers’ bodies.</li>
<li>Democracy is a way of organizing political life in which many people are given authority.</li>
<li>Do these people have authority over mothers’ bodies?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 2 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>That was a way of putting it.</li>
<li>Bodies change over time. The study of this we call physics.</li>
<li>The studies of more complex bodies have other names.</li>
<li>One of the names for the study of political bodies is democracy.</li>
<li>Political bodies are always composed of human bodies.</li>
<li>They share similar features, like the relations of parts to wholes.</li>
<li>To be political is, first and foremost, to have a body, and to be part of a body.</li>
<li>I put my body into the larger body.</li>
<li>Is this sexual? Almost. Or at least, eventually.</li>
<li>This is a part of being a culture.</li>
<li>This is being cultured.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 3 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Humans seem able to affect one another at a distance.</li>
<li>Physicists have shown that fields act at a distance.</li>
<li>Is this electrical? Maybe. Are our brains not electrical?</li>
<li>Who has not noticed a moon and sensed that somewhere another was noticing the same moon?</li>
<li>The art of cultivating these signals, transmitted one to another, is aesthetics.</li>
<li>But first we must dampen the noise.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 4 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>How terrifying, to know that there are others.</li>
<li>Not only to know, but to feel them.</li>
<li>We must not slink from the terror.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 5 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We must stop deceiving our children with the lie that they choose who they are.</li>
<li>When we tell them this, we are making them into something.</li>
<li>We should consider whether it is what we want them to be.</li>
<li>But if not freedom, then what?</li>
<li>A culture is not chosen. It is continued.</li>
<li>Becoming informed by a culture is always painful. But it need not be made more painful.</li>
<li>Culture comes to us first through our mothers' bodies.</li>
<li>Later, it comes through food, rituals, and sex.</li>
<li>We do choose whether or not to engage in these things. But we do not choose which of them will resonate with us.</li>
<li>If we lose touch with the things that resonate with us, we begin to fade.</li>
<li>It is not good to fade.</li>
<li>The culture of freedom pretends to be chosen. It even demands it.</li>
<li>But what other choice did most of us have?</li>
<li>We continue it, so that we will not fade.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 6 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>People are so often not on the same page.</li>
<li>Are they in the same book?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 7 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Kant says that the only moral law is to allow each individual to express his or her autonomous will.</li>
<li>But where do these wills come from?</li>
<li>Surely from our bodies.</li>
<li>Surely from our cultures.</li>
<li>How else would individuals know what to want?</li>
<li>I want to be an autonomous individual, like everyone else.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 8 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Moralities are enforced through punishment.</li>
<li>We punish those who are not individual enough.</li>
<li>But what about family?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 9 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Families make the same kind of noise.</li>
<li>We need to be near those who make familiar noise, because otherwise we fade.</li>
<li>A family can be made from autonomous individuals, but something is missing.</li>
<li>What is missing is the recognition of similarity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 10 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We are made similar by the absorption of culture.</li>
<li>Does culture exist at the level of micro-organisms?</li>
<li>In yogurt it does.</li>
<li>Are we made similar by sharing yogurt?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 11 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is just one example.</li>
<li>We are certainly made similar through sex.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 12 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What if the yogurt goes bad?</li>
<li>Will the reaction in my gut affect my will?</li>
<li>Yes, it surely will.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 13 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Those who have better yogurt will have better bodies and minds.</li>
<li>Perhaps this is usually better left unsaid.</li>
<li>We don’t want to arouse the anger of those who have had bad yogurt, through no fault of their own.</li>
<li>One cannot put new yogurt into old yogurt cups.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 14 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But what if we <em>do</em> put new yogurt into old yogurt cups?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 15 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The point of life is to blossom, and to thrive.</li>
<li>To spread our influence, and to make that influence endure.</li>
<li>The best way to make influence endure is to genuinely benefit others.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 16 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The culture of freedom has many benefits, but it does not leave much room for influencing others.</li>
<li>So then what is life for?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 17 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Moral purity is not an end in itself.</li>
<li>It is at best a means of increasing our capacity to benefit others.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 18 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Roman law promises power that can never exist for humans.</li>
<li>It is the power of making a decree that is valid always and everywhere.</li>
<li>Human laws are contingent.</li>
<li>Thinkers in the early modern period began to notice this.</li>
<li>They said that power derives from the consent of the governed.</li>
<li>But this is only part of the story.</li>
<li>No amount of voting can make men immortal, or less dependent on food.</li>
<li>Power may be maintained by the consent of the governed, but it derives from nature.</li>
<li>In particular, from biological processes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 19 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>I reject the idea that nature is ruthless.</li>
<li>Humans are ruthless. Nature is very lazy. </li>
<li>Nature is only ruthless when threatened.</li>
<li>If humans are often ruthless, it is only because they are often threatened.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 20 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>I think we are in a dark age.</li>
<li>The difference between a dark age and a light age is that nobody in the future will look to the dark age as an example.</li>
<li>I cannot recommend looking to us as an example.</li>
<li>We do not know what we are doing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 21 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We must try to know what we are doing.</li>
<li>How can we find an example?</li>
<li>There have been light ages, but their examples blind us.</li>
<li>We may not adjust well to their light.</li>
<li>We must look for examples that meet us where we are.</li>
<li>Or can we become such examples?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 22 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>How can we become such examples?</li>
<li>By returning to fundamentals.</li>
<li>By encountering plants and animals.</li>
<li>By gardening.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 23 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>All good examples move carefully.</li>
<li>This is a test of goodness.</li>
<li>The thrill of annihilation is barbaric.</li>
<li>Good examples are not barbaric.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 24 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Good examples cultivate society like a garden.</li>
<li>They dislike weeds as much as barbarians.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 25 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Since the discovery of the New World, one of the dominant modes of power in Western Europe has been Giver of Gifts from Afar.</li>
<li>Those with more foreign gifts have had more power.</li>
<li>Perhaps we are stretched too thin, “like butter spread over too much bread.”</li>
<li>We could make do with more butter or less bread.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 26 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>This mode of power is even more prevalent in the New World itself.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 27 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The chief virtue in a liberal society is humility.</li>
<li>One cannot know what another values.</li>
<li>Are there simply too many values?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 28 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But are we to value liberalism? Or liberty? Or life and the pursuit of happiness?</li>
<li>How should we treat those who do not value these things?</li>
<li>Should we educate them? Punish them? Tolerate them?</li>
<li>Each path has its advantages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 29 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We should culture with them.</li>
<li>We should adapt to them, and hope that they likewise adapt to us.</li>
<li>We should evolve together.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 30 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But we should recognize some limitations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 31 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Aristotle was wrong to project human reasoning onto the cosmos.</li>
<li>The cosmos is not rational.</li>
<li>Only humans are rational.</li>
<li>Reasoning is a human activity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 32 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Then, what is the cosmos?</li>
<li>It is chaos. </li>
<li>But this cannot be. The cosmos is stable.</li>
<li>Then it is a collection of balanced opposites.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 33 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The interplay of opposites, we call culture.</li>
<li>It is well that these forces have a common ancestor.</li>
<li>That is why they can harmonize.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 34 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Reasoning is one kind of culture. It is not unique to humans, though humans are skilled at it.</li>
<li>Reasoning cannot transcend life.</li>
<li>Reasoning depends on life.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 35 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>For centuries, mystics have claimed that ultimate reality is unknowable.</li>
<li>No doubt we will continue ignoring them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 36 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Many humans believe that they have control over their lives.</li>
<li>I doubt this, but the belief is important.</li>
<li>Without it, we may not survive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 37 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What does belief offer us?</li>
<li>A shared cooperative framework.</li>
<li>An understanding of which behaviors are permitted and which are punished.</li>
<li>Without these, there could be no cities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 38 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Aristotle’s folly, and ours, lies in seeking a universal belief.</li>
<li>There can never be any such thing.</li>
<li>Logic is in the mind, if we’re lucky.</li>
<li>It can never be anywhere else.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 39 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Perhaps it would be better to call this Alexander’s folly.</li>
<li>Belief spread by the sword.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 40 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>There is a cooperative spirit in humans more magnificent than in any other animal.</li>
<li>This is enabled by belief in a common cause.</li>
<li>But whose cause?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 41 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The cultural marxists think they can do away with belief.</li>
<li>How will they feel when we stop believing in their cause?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 42 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The meritocrats believe in ambition alone.</li>
<li>Does this not uproot all belief?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 43 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The cause must be cooperative.</li>
<li>It doesn’t matter whose it is.</li>
<li>It also must sustain us.</li>
<li>The cause cannot transcend life.</li>
</ul>
