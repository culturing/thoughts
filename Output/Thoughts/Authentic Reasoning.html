                <h2>Authentic Reasoning</h2>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>May 2024</small></small></em></p>

<h3>- 1 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Synthetic <em>a priori</em> judgments are not necessary for metaphysics.</li>
<li>All that is necessary is failed expectations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 2 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We have a concept of a thing.</li>
<li>This concept always includes expectations about how the thing will behave.</li>
<li>It's actual behavior differs from the expected, causing wonder.</li>
<li>Thus begins philosophy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 3 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The first inkling of a thing-in-itself, a beyond, a more-than-meets-the-eye, comes when a thing fails to meet our expectations.</li>
<li>It surprises us.</li>
<li>It must have properties that we did not take into account.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 4 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is the root of all negative theologies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 5 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>One of the most important skills for a human to learn is how to navigate through confusion.</li>
<li>The confusion must not be encouraged, but cannot be avoided.</li>
<li>We cannot defeat it with violence, in Roman style.</li>
<li>We must learn to wander through it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 6 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We in the West are acclimated to clarity.</li>
<li>We have ascended the hills of the gods and seen further than others.</li>
<li>But how shall we adjust to the thick air of the earth?</li>
<li>Hilltop habits are no use here.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 7 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We have hints of a "higher" reality.</li>
<li>But these only indicate faults in our thinking.</li>
<li>They cannot indicate more.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 8 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Thus far with Kant.</li>
<li>But Kant still wants to rescue mankind from confusion.</li>
<li>I think he was confused about this.</li>
<li>There is no rescue.</li>
<li>But he was not the first to seek one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 9 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Plato struggled in the contest to make clear hints of a "higher" reality.</li>
<li>He succeeded admirably. The hints are still unclear.</li>
<li>Perhaps his struggle is ethical, not scientific.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 10 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Aristotle made the hints much clearer.</li>
<li>For this reason, his philosophy (in the hands of others) became dogmatic and tyrannical.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 11 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Kant inherited a lust for clarity.</li>
<li>He found a new means to that end.</li>
<li>But how is reason more clear than things-in-themselves?</li>
<li>"Reason" is not better than "substance" or other terms of the schoolmen.</li>
<li>We cannot nail it down.</li>
<li>We do not know what reason is, any more than we know anything else.</li>
<li>We cannot know reason as it is in itself.</li>
<li>Thus the psychologists, disturbed by what lies under reason (Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, James, Freud)</li>
<li>The psychologists still hear the hints.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 12 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But we need not be disturbed by hints.</li>
<li>We must learn to wander, even through our own selves.</li>
<li>Only then can we find the way.</li>
<li>It will not be provided for us.</li>
<li>Who could provide it?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 13 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Nature is wild energies at war.</li>
<li>Chaos is normal. Order is rare.</li>
<li>But for that reason order is precious. </li>
<li>We cannot live without it.</li>
<li>It is not precious because it conforms to nature.</li>
<li>It is precious because it resists nature.</li>
<li>We build structures to keep nature out.</li>
<li>Otherwise nature would kill us.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 14 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>One of those structures has been metaphysics.</li>
<li>It has served a purpose but can do so no longer.</li>
<li>What else can serve this purpose?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 15 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Things are never what they used to be.</li>
<li>This is another way in which they surprise us.</li>
<li>They change over time.</li>
<li>We call this history.</li>
<li>What would it mean to belong within history?</li>
<li>To situate oneself in a stream of ideas flowing through a community over time?</li>
<li>How important it would be to leave good ideas behind!</li>
<li>For those to come! For those to come!</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 16 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Kant's dissection of reason has killed the patient.</li>
<li>Reason has become too self-aware.</li>
<li>It is time for a new beginning.</li>
<li>But what is old is new again.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 17 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We carry history within us.</li>
<li>In our bones, in our hearts, in our DNA.</li>
<li>Why have we not attended to it?</li>
<li>It is always there waiting for us.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 18 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>I am not sure that there are any <em>a priori</em> judgments at all.</li>
<li>Infants cannot do math.</li>
<li>Children learn by counting objects.</li>
<li>They carry those memories with them into every calculation.</li>
<li>What Kant called <em>a priori</em> are really products of learning.</li>
<li>They are habits, based on prior experience.</li>
<li>Even Kant's favorite example, 7 + 5 = 12, fails.</li>
<li>We experience a group of objects.</li>
<li>These groups can be divided into smaller groups.</li>
<li>Thus a group of 12 can be divided into groups of 7 and 5.</li>
<li>This is part of the concept of a positive integer.</li>
<li>Therefore by Kant's definition it is analytic, and the object analyzed is the sum.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 19 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>More interesting is the nature of whole and parts.</li>
<li>What is a One?</li>
<li>I have one body, but that body is arms and legs and hair, and each of these is blood and tissue and muscle, etc.</li>
<li>So in what sense do I have <em>one</em> body?</li>
<li>It seems to be a product of reason.</li>
<li>But my reason, or cosmic reason?</li>
<li>This is a very old question.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 20 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Probably my reason.</li>
<li>Again thus far with Kant, but also with Parmenides, Plato, and Plotinus.</li>
<li>The uneasiness of reason will not easily be sloughed off.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 21 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Natural law (with its bastard Deism) was a grave error.</li>
<li>There are no laws of nature.</li>
<li>Law is a human creation.</li>
<li>Nature has patterns, but who knows if they will continue?</li>
<li>Do we not experience frequent surprises?</li>
<li>What could enforce the "laws of nature?"</li>
<li>Is nature not free to disobey?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 22 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Reason conforms to supposed laws of nature at its peril.</li>
<li>Reason must impose order on chaos.</li>
<li>Postmoderns face this dilemma: reason or chaos?</li>
<li>But we must have both.</li>
<li>Reason is the master of chaos.</li>
<li>Chaos is what calls for reason.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 23 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>It bears repeating that reason does not imitate nature.</li>
<li>Nothing in nature resembles human laws.</li>
<li>Nothing in nature can ground human laws.</li>
<li>Reason opposes nature.</li>
<li>But this opposition is the fundamental human experience.</li>
<li>We must stop viewing nature as a rational whole.</li>
<li>We must attend to those parts of it that we can master.</li>
<li>But we will never master all of it.</li>
<li>Even the attempt is hubris, and we are guilty of this arrogance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 24 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>How much of nature (or how many natures) have we mastered?</li>
<li>It varies.</li>
<li>But always keep watch for the charlatans who claim to have mastered all.</li>
<li>You will know them by your sense of unease.</li>
<li>Do not reach for heaven when earth will do.</li>
<li>But do not settle for earth uninformed.</li>
<li>This last has its charlatans too.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 25 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We must continue to think about the parts of nature that are beyond reason.</li>
<li>We cannot organize them, but we can organize ourselves in light of them.</li>
<li>We must be orderly, even when nature is disorderly.</li>
<li>This is reason's highest purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 26 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Nature is not our role model.</li>
<li>Nature is only itself.</li>
<li>A belief in natural law no longer helps us.</li>
<li>It has damaged our sexuality.</li>
<li>It has damaged our self-esteem.</li>
<li>These are bitter pills, though clich√©.</li>
<li>We need a new style of reasoning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 27 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The new reason must be lighthearted and free from absolutes.</li>
<li>It must tolerate disagreement.</li>
<li>It must play with its subject.</li>
<li>It must not dominate.</li>
<li><em>It must be authentic</em>.</li>
