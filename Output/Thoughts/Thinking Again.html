                <h2>Thinking Again</h2>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>February 2024</small></small></em></p>

<h3>- 1 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What Bacon calls Idols do inhibit rational thought, but they are also the foundation of community.</li>
<li>They enable shared belief.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 2 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Science is here to stay, but it must not rule.</li>
<li>It must learn its subordinate place.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 3 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But subordinate to whom? Not the Volk...</li>
<li>Perhaps to a species of man which has rarely prospered in the West: the Chun-tzse, the master of culture, humbled by much study, ruled by intelligence, and ruling in kind.</li>
<li>But what is this intelligence if not scientific? Not Christian either...</li>
<li>It is wise, far-seeing, strategic, long-term, with its roots and its blossoms in <em>memory</em>, not in <em>power</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 4 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>First we revere the past.</li>
<li>Then we make the present worthy of reverence, by means of the past, for the sake of the future.</li>
<li>What kind of world? What kind of world?</li>
<li>Man's limits are not what we think they are.</li>
<li>Perhaps we have had false gods, but that does not mean all gods are false.</li>
<li>Conduct must be governed somehow.</li>
<li>We live no other way.</li>
<li>Freedom is a god, and a questionable one. </li>
<li>Tomorrow we may have another god.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 5 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Germans are always sacking Rome. They cannot help it.</li>
<li>What was the Reformation if not another sack of Rome?</li>
<li>Perhaps some of Rome is worth keeping.</li>
<li>Perhaps some of Germany is worth keeping too.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 6 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Why did Rome need to be sacked?</li>
<li>Was it too omnipotent?</li>
<li>Did it rule by force and repress nature?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 7 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The lesson of Rome is that no power can be universal.</li>
<li>The Romans did not know what was good for Germany, or for Greece, or for Asia Minor, or for Israel.</li>
<li>They only knew what was good for Rome (if that).</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 8 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>There are many forms of rule, and <em>imperium</em> is only the most common in the West.</li>
<li>Imperium is spectacularly efficient but stifles creativity and initiative.</li>
<li>It is only for people who know the answers in advance.</li>
<li>It is only for people who know the questions in advance.</li>
<li>It is not for people who discover.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 9 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The scientific method was a sharp break from imperium.</li>
<li>It claims that human knowledge is always provisional. Discovery is essential.</li>
<li>This was necessary in order to secure for thinking a place where things can change.</li>
<li>But it is not necessary that all things be subject to change at all times.</li>
<li>This is a new, nasty, scientific imperialism, commanding disobedience, perennial re-evaluation, skepticism.</li>
<li>How can we obey? How can we disobey?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 10 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Let us think harder before we obey.</li>
<li>Let us think harder before we disobey.</li>
<li>Let us think and then decide.</li>
<li>The answers may not be known until there has been thinking.</li>
<li>The questions may not be known until there has been thinking.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 11 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Nature is not lawful in the way the Romans were lawful.</li>
<li>It is not so efficient.</li>
<li>It is prone to accidents and wild chance.</li>
<li>The gods can be abusive.</li>
<li>We should not necessarily imitate gods or Nature (which is only a god)</li>
<li>But this is a sign that something is wrong with our gods.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 12 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Imperium does not belong to the cosmos.</li>
<li>Imperium is manmade, and can be unmade.</li>
<li>What happens to us when we unmake it?</li>
<li>Are we "lost in an endless nothing?"</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 13 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We are not lost in an endless nothing, though we were for a time.</li>
<li>We are not gods ourselves, though we were for a time.</li>
<li>We are the ones who tell stories about the gods.</li>
<li>We can always tell new stories.</li>
<li>But we must not abuse this privilege.</li>
<li>Our lives depend on it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 14 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is a story worth telling?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 15 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We are now two-hundred years into the experiment of making every man a king.</li>
<li>Allow me to suggest that it is not going well.</li>
<li>Where is the noble self-discipline?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 16 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The West has always had trouble organizing itself.</li>
<li>We like war too much.</li>
<li>We like money too much.</li>
<li>We do not like good government enough.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 17 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>One can only assume that our mistrust of government is well-earned.</li>
<li>But that only means that we must govern better.</li>
<li>We must also <em>be governed</em> better, be more governable.</li>
<li>The obligation goes both ways.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 18 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>A good governor first governs himself.</li>
<li>If he cannot do this, how can he govern others?</li>
<li>If he can do this, what more is required?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 19 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Luck is required, and rare.</li>
<li>But we must do all that we can.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 20 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Every belief can be questioned.</li>
<li>Or can it?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 21 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Descartes' <em>cogito ergo sum</em>, I think therefore I am, was meant to provide certainty.</li>
<li>It does not succeed.</li>
<li>Grounding certainty on thinking makes both silly.</li>
<li>Thinking is more akin to uncertainty.</li>
<li>Certainty comes from elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 22 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Certainty belongs to the realm of religion.</li>
<li>Some raise Cartesian scientism to the level of religion.</li>
<li>This makes actual thinking impossible, because authentic thinking never knows where (or if) it will arrive.</li>
<li>For Cartesians (as for Calvinists), certainty is a forgone conclusion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 23 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Why did such a love of certainty emerge?</li>
<li>It must be from the Romans, who loved obedience and considered authorities absolute.</li>
<li>But this Roman obedience has merged with Greek thoughtfulness to create a certainty fetish.</li>
<li>Thinking and believing must be kept separate.</li>
<li>The tyranny of thoughts is the most common tyranny today.</li>
<li>This would have been foreign to Greeks or Romans, though both have contributed to it.</li>
<li>What can govern us, it not ideas we hold certain?</li>
<li>What can govern us, if no idea is certain?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 24 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We need new and better examples.</li>
<li>Examples of both thinking and obedience, kept apart.</li>
<li>There is a time to think and a time to obey.</li>
<li>And there are some who have done each well.</li>
<li>But there are few who have done both well.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 25 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>I doubt they can be done together.</li>
<li>Thinking is for the few, belief for the many.</li>
<li>These few do not think in order to believe or believe in order to think.</li>
<li>They think in order to think.</li>
<li>Likewise, the many believe in order to believe.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 26 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Why not simply "I am"?</li>
<li>What does the "cogito ergo" add?</li>
<li>But "I am" has been spoken before, by one more powerful than Descartes.</li>
<li>Would Descartes take His place via thinking?</li>
<li>Would Science take His place via thinking?</li>
<li>Is he founding a religion?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 27 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>He is founding the echo of a religion, or better, of three religions.</li>
<li>He is composing a new harmony of the same old motifs.</li>
<li>Are we not tired of these songs?</li>
<li>Are we not tired of the ways in which they never fit together?</li>
<li>What is <em>our</em> motif?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 28 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>It is time that we think again.</li>
<li>Time, time, time...with all of its random interjections, the past as harmful as helpful.</li>
<li>How are we unlike the Romans?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 30 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We do not believe that we are close to the gods.</li>
<li>We do not believe in ourselves.</li>
<li>Instead, we believe in Democracy, Science, etc...methods and processes.</li>
<li>How is a method not simply a ritual?</li>
<li>Why do we expect our rituals to succeed?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 31 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Because the Romans taught us this expectation.</li>
<li>It has no ground under it.</li>
<li>We can do the right thing and still fail.</li>
<li>It happens all the time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 32 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We may be more likely to succeed if we do the right thing.</li>
<li>But there is no guarantee.</li>
<li>We may be more likely to fail if we do the wrong thing.</li>
<li>But there is no guarantee.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 33 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We must stop blaming victims of cosmic caprice.</li>
<li>Pain does not imply moral failure.</li>
<li>Pain implies only itself.</li>
<li>Blame leads to repression, festering, monstrousness.</li>
<li>Let the pain go. Release it. Be free.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 34 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But how can we release pain without causing harm?</li>
<li>Carefully and in controlled spaces.</li>
<li>Is this not also Roman?</li>
<li>Perhaps it is not all bad.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 35 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The space between essence and appearance is what calls for thinking.</li>
<li>This is in answer to Heidegger.</li>
<li>Hegel identified essence with appearance.</li>
<li>Thus, he disabled all thinking.</li>
<li>But are things as they appear?</li>
<li>Thinkers beg to differ.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 36 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is there to think, except a hidden essence?</li>
<li>What can ground authority, except skill with essence?</li>
<li>Hegel's "essence = appearance" is egalitarian.</li>
<li>It aims to make essence accessible to all.</li>
<li>But it clouds the hidden essence. It lies. It deceives.</li>
<li>Aristotle knew better.</li>
<li>He was wise to separate potentials (essence) from actuals (appearance) and to base most of his philosophy on this distinction (notwithstanding Medieval corruptions of his thinking).</li>
<li>But he may have overestimated his ability to speak clearly about hidden essences.</li>
<li>Discovery is always delicate.</li>
<li>Essence can only be seen with peripheral vision.</li>
<li>Then again, maybe Aristotle knew this, and it is only his followers who do not.</li>
<li>Is this why he wrote with broken syntax?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 37 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>To do <em>that here</em> is not more offensive that to do <em>this there</em>.</li>
<li>Both sides see clearly now.</li>
<li>How can we learn from each other?</li>
</ul>
