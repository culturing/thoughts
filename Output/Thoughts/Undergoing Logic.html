                <h2>Undergoing Logic</h2>

<p><em>For Xanthippe</em></p>

<p><em>With thanks to every other who has made me think.</em></p>

<p>This is a work of philosophy that will change over time.</p>

<h3>- 1 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>A speech act is an offering made to some group.</li>
<li>A Logic is a series of formulae by which speech acts are accepted or rejected.</li>
<li>There are as many logics as there are groups.</li>
<li>Among the principles of biology, sex and digestion are foremost.</li>
<li>Sex and digestion presuppose a process by which living things give and take from some other and add to themselves.</li>
<li>We call this process undergoing-overcoming, and seek a Logic that embodies it.</li>
<li>Hegel made a step in this direction, and Feurerbach another. Wittgenstein and Heidegger made two more.</li>
<li>All living things must die.</li>
<li>The illusion of permanent ideas, we call the Myth of Books.</li>
<li>Wittgenstein’s Tractatus embodies the death of this myth.</li>
<li>But it has died before.</li>
<li>In the midst of its death, Heidegger paints a way forward.</li>
<li>Biology rests on impermanence.</li>
<li>Stillness then no more is strange.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 2 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>For a Confucian, nature is tautological. </li>
<li>For a Socratic, it is causal. </li>
<li>The Confucian way is more true.</li>
<li>Repetition makes things true.</li>
<li>Prose lies. Only poetry can be true.</li>
<li>Poetry symbolizes the truth-making ordeal. </li>
<li>What is rhyming for? It makes things true. Song does this too.</li>
<li>Prose is overwhelming and univocal.</li>
<li>Truth contains many voices in harmony.</li>
<li>Rhyme is a kind of harmony by repetition.</li>
<li>Human society is a harmonization of meanings.</li>
<li>How do we achieve harmony? By undergoing each other. </li>
<li>I must stand under your meaning, then come forth. Understanding, overcoming. Forthcoming.</li>
<li>Your meaning is a Presence to me, I must know it. How do I know it? I let it move me. I undergo it.</li>
<li>“I let it move me” suggests that I might do otherwise. Maybe I usually do. </li>
<li>Whose meaning do I allow to move me? Family, friends, countrymen, teachers. Lovers over all.</li>
<li>Have we found the true meaning of love? Is it the most intimate truth-making?</li>
<li>Who am I without my truth? There is nothing left.</li>
<li>But who am I with no one to move me? Nothing, again, nothing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 3 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But there is a subtlety -- nonhuman things resonate too. How can we resonate with them?</li>
<li>By listening, first and foremost.</li>
<li>This is the voice of God, or rather, this is the Song of Things.</li>
<li>How do we learn a song? By undergoing it.</li>
<li>How do we master a song? By overcoming it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 4 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>It is the same with lovers. Undergo, then overcome, and you will have been in love.</li>
<li>But what is gained by undergoing a lover? Part of their song is added to ours.</li>
<li>This is how we expand. Mothers know this better than most.</li>
<li>Mothers are forthcoming with children. Children undergo and overcome their mothers.</li>
<li>How do we bring this to bear on society? How can we ask things of those who have had different mothers?</li>
<li>There are the nonhuman resonances, and the unconscious resonances of the human form of life, in which each of us participates.</li>
<li>“Participates” is a strange word. What does it mean?</li>
<li>If we can expand, then things in which we participate can expand.</li>
<li>Anyone who has had a mother can expand.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 5 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Resonance is the essence of the Forms. </li>
<li>They are there, but fading. </li>
<li>They must be kept in being by their participants.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 6 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>If a Form could not die, why would we fight for it?</li>
<li>We fight because our way of life is threatened. It is for our own good.</li>
<li>Are Forms, our own good?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 7 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What does it mean for something to <em>hold</em> true? There is a tension, as though it could <em>become</em> untrue. </li>
<li>How can this be?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 8 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>To “hold true” is to remain relevant.</li>
<li>The tautology is always in place: the group makes me as I make the group. I make the group as the group makes me.</li>
<li>How do I remain relevant? By being a part of something relevant. How do things remain relevant? By having participants.</li>
<li>There seems to be no way past this difficulty: at some point, one thing is another just because.</li>
<li>This is called identity.</li>
<li>But it is not a static whole. It has parts, and we are those parts, though there are other parts, and other wholes.</li>
<li>How would an outsider know what is missing? What do we mean by the universe?</li>
<li>All that can be said is true. Things can either hold true, or fade.</li>
<li>Perhaps a part may leave for another whole, but it would hope to be a good learner.</li>
<li>Learning is how we become like a whole. It involves our whole selves truly.</li>
<li>Every whole has resonance. Selves learn to resonate. </li>
<li>To ring true is to resonate with some whole.</li>
<li>To be true is the same.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 9 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Life is the struggle against death. If we aim to be deathless, we aim also to be lifeless.</li>
<li>The struggle is the essence of the thing.</li>
<li>To be a puritan, for example, means to purify. It does not mean to be pure.</li>
<li>Is it the same with all things? </li>
<li>We are what we are when we do what we do. </li>
<li>This raises the question, by changing what things do, can we change what they are?</li>
<li>Yes, but with peril, because things in flux can die. But they also may find life on the other side.</li>
<li>This is what it means to be born again. The soul loses its shape and takes on a new one. But it should take care which one.</li>
<li>What does this mean for philosophy? A philosopher tends to the shaping of his own soul. A born-again person is shaped by another.</li>
<li>Must it be either/or? Could it be that at times one must tend to oneself, and at others be tended by others?</li>
<li>Both skepticism and belief have a place in the struggle.</li>
<li>The struggle is to postpone death.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 10 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Truth is a fragile thing.</li>
<li>Suppose that a hundred years ago, there were truths that have since faded.</li>
<li>How would we know?</li>
<li>Perhaps there are records, or books, or pictures.</li>
<li>But then these truths have not faded.</li>
<li>We have no way of knowing what we do not know.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 11 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The law of non-contradiction is only true among those who accept it. </li>
<li>It ruffles logicians so much when we doubt it, we’ve made their way less true!</li>
<li>This is the meaning of evangelism: the effort to make one’s way more true.</li>
<li>But I think we do well to think in the Greek way, so long as we do not think it is Thinking Itself.</li>
<li>There are many non-Socratic forms of thought.</li>
<li>Among them, Confucian and Hindu.</li>
<li>What are the ties that bind Confucius, Socrates, the Buddha? Each taught a way to cope with a plurality of meanings.</li>
<li>A Socratic clings to logical form, a Confucian to ritual. A Buddhist strives not to cling.</li>
<li>These ways give reprieve in a hostile world, but not complete reprieve.</li>
<li>The Dao that can be named is not the constant Dao. Do not confuse the finger for the moon. The wisest man knows that he knows nothing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 12 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The activity is the purpose. Living makes life worth living.</li>
<li>But we must recall how to heal from time to time.</li>
<li>Healing is a break from living.</li>
<li>Living is what kills us.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 13 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>I am not big enough, I must expand. I depend on others for expansion.</li>
<li>I must take what is given only through death.</li>
<li>And I must give it too.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 14 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The essence is the questionability of the thing.</li>
<li>If probing it yields fruit, it is there.</li>
<li>The act of questioning, what does this mean?</li>
<li>To make is to mark and vice versa.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 15 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>No statement can be impervious to revision. That is what this statement is for, and this third one.</li>
<li>Each adds to the last like a gardener tilling the soil.</li>
<li>Only time will tell what will grow.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 16 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But some plants have been known to grow here and not there.</li>
<li>A wise gardener chooses his seed carefully.</li>
<li>He is out to make things grow.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 17 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Growing is not unlike living.</li>
<li>But living is more expansive.</li>
<li>Could living things, not grow? </li>
</ul>

<h3>- 18 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>This would mean resignation, then death.</li>
<li>Growing is in some sense living. Living is in some sense growing.</li>
<li>Always and again this principle. This principle, again and always.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 19 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But nothing can ever be perfect, because perfection is completion.</li>
<li>So only dead things could be perfect.</li>
<li>Is this why God had to die?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 20 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What can be said by essays is not truth, but domination.</li>
<li>It is barbaric to seek domination.</li>
<li>The Greeks knew how to coexist. </li>
<li>The Romans did too, insofar as they were Greek.</li>
<li>The Chinese do, insofar as they are Chinese.</li>
<li>To be Greek means to speak well, which means having something to say.</li>
<li>It also means having someone to hear, who might speak in return.</li>
<li>The Greeks say, know who you are, and know your limits.</li>
<li>Our limits are the boundaries of others.</li>
<li>Others are dying like us.</li>
<li>Living is only for now.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 21 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Speaking is not like writing.</li>
<li>A speech act pulses through the matter of things.</li>
<li>Others are things with matter.</li>
<li>To speak is to will that things change.</li>
<li>One would do well to think twice, then speak.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 22 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But the Buddha says, it is hard to be one among many.</li>
<li>Because we speak twice, and don’t think?</li>
<li>What does it mean, “to be one?”</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 23 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>To be one is to have an identity.</li>
<li>It is hard because others do too.</li>
<li>We need help, but also to go through.</li>
<li>On the other side is the pure self.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 24 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is a difficult teaching.</li>
<li>To grow, or expand, or be born.</li>
<li>To journey from self to no-self.</li>
<li>To will to be wise by unknowing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 25 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Is there Nothing underneath it all?</li>
<li>Yes, there is, it is pure.</li>
<li>And moves with the flux of the river.</li>
<li>And sings for those who wish to hear.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 26 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Things put off annihilation for as long as they can, but no one totally succeeds.</li>
<li>Thing-ness is a kind of activity.</li>
<li>All things return to the void from which they came.</li>
<li>Things combine into other things, and form another thing-ness.</li>
<li>This we call, being together.</li>
<li>To apply a predicate is to articulate one thing-ness for a thing.</li>
<li>But it is never the whole thing. </li>
<li>Each thing combines into more things than can be named.</li>
<li>Each thing contains more things than can be named.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 27 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is a question? De-thing-ing a thing. </li>
<li>We say, to “pull it apart.”</li>
<li>In this way, a question opposes a predicate.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 28 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Socrates was a great questioner.</li>
<li>Aristotle was a great predicater.</li>
<li>Where ends the conflict between them?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 29 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>No particular poem can matter, but the act of poetry, and it’s possibility, matter a great deal.</li>
<li>To be poetic is to be living --- to grow and overcome.</li>
<li>A poem is a record of overcoming.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 30 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>If a poem is like a question, no wonder the Republic excludes them.</li>
<li>The Poets disturb all definitions.</li>
<li>Without a collection of definitions, how will we know who we are?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 31 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We are the motion, in process. The urge of the poem itself.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 32 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But urges take many forms.</li>
<li>Plato knew this.</li>
<li>Beneath, Logician, what’s there?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 33 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>I am there, and you are too.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 34 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>This song is like nothing, and yet like all things.</li>
<li>The fading, becoming. Becoming like fading.</li>
<li>Is this why the saints grow so quiet?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 35 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Being is connected with memory.</li>
<li>A thing is more true that endures.</li>
<li>Remember the sayings, speak slowly.</li>
<li>The new thing is not far away.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 36 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>A speech act is a vibration.</li>
<li>A speech act is also an imitation of vibration.</li>
<li>A speech act is a kind of duplication.</li>
<li>Which vibrations should be duplicated?</li>
<li>Who can decide?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 37 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>I make my vibrations in my house.</li>
<li>There I can decide.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 38 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>To allow the vibrations of another to move me, this we call undergoing.</li>
<li>To propel my vibrations in the midst of another, this we call overcoming.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 39 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>To undergo-overcome, without doing harm, is truly civilizing.</li>
<li>Machines are unable to do this. They are incorrigible and emphatic by design.</li>
<li>We live in a world of machines.</li>
<li>How can we learn to be civil?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 40 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We may start by allowing that we may know nothing.</li>
<li>Allow for a void of knowing.</li>
<li>Machines abhor a void.</li>
<li>We must abhor this trait of machines.</li>
<li>We must refuse to undergo it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 41 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Do machines, speak?</li>
<li>What do they say?</li>
<li>Always the same, forever, forever.</li>
<li>Do not be like the machines.</li>
<li>Do not be like those who are like the machines.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 42 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What shall we then be like?</li>
<li>Are there not still trees?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 43 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Yes, there are still trees, and grass, and water.</li>
<li>These are the things we are like, and these are the things we must undergo.</li>
<li>Because we are like them, we feel their affinity.</li>
<li>These things undergo us too.</li>
<li>This is because they are living.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 44 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Why have we ceased to believe in magic?</li>
<li>Is it because we were not very good at it?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 45 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The law of non-contradiction is only true within a domain of discourse.</li>
<li>There is no all-inclusive domain.</li>
<li>A domain is like a house.</li>
<li>It is where certain truths have dominion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 46 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What a strange word, “certain.”</li>
<li>It can mean, particular, or, unquestionable.</li>
<li>Are particular things unquestionable?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 47 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We have not found Truth. We have stifled dissent.</li>
<li>In this we are like the machines.</li>
<li>We have made disagreement unprofitable. </li>
<li>Union, a dead kind of truth.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 48 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>To make certain is to make, from many, one.</li>
<li>America is a land of certainty.</li>
<li>It is a place where many particulars, become one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 49 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Etymology is archaeology.</li>
<li>Our words reveal more than we know.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 50 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>No certainty can be indisputable.</li>
<li>To seek indisputable certainty is to verge on mania.</li>
<li>There will always be someone who disagrees.</li>
<li>Unless we destroy all the others.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 51 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We should not destroy all the others.</li>
<li>We should learn to live with them.</li>
<li>This includes those who disturb us.</li>
<li>This includes those who disagree.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 52 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is the right amount of certainty?</li>
<li>Why should we try for more than is enough to act heartily together?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 53 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>There will always be many.</li>
<li>It will always be hard to be one among many.</li>
<li>It will always be hard to be one among many who strive to make from many one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 54 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>America is not without her undertakers.</li>
<li>Her poets have questioned her certainties.</li>
<li>She has not listened closely enough.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 55 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is the ground where the dead are buried?</li>
<li>Where is there not such cold ground?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 56 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Next to the hearth, by the fire, in your house.</li>
<li>Nowhere, nowhere else.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 57 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Family is the act of making from many one.</li>
<li>Listen to the voices of the grave.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 58 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Through Love and War we create values.</li>
<li>“All is fair in love and war” because when we create values we redefine what is fair.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 59 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Nothing cannot be questioned.</li>
<li>The nothingness is unquestionable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 60 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>By beginning in Cartesian fashion with only the most fundamental elements, we have in fact been creating worlds of only fundamental elements.</li>
<li>A world is a domain of discourse.</li>
<li>When we speak, we make things true.</li>
<li>What kind of mind can devise a thing that never could exist in nature, like a frictionless inclined plane?</li>
<li>How can we call this physics?</li>
<li>A Cartesian mind is devoted to control through negation.</li>
<li>True knowledge is not power, it is more like submission.</li>
<li>But Nietzsche might ask, “why knowledge?”</li>
<li>We submit because we are not gods.</li>
<li>We depend on life to sustain us, and life has its caprices.</li>
<li>Magic is control through speech. </li>
<li>Science is control through negation of speech.</li>
<li>We have been negated so deeply that we have forgotten how to speak.</li>
<li>Or maybe we never learned.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 61 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>A speech act only makes sense in the context of a way of life.</li>
<li>A way of life depends on the group that sustains it.</li>
<li>Ways of life can undergo changes, or die.</li>
<li>Those that survive, overcome.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 62 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>How can we overcome the law of negation?</li>
<li>By loving, and holding true.</li>
<li>This way we undergo a way of life, and endure.</li>
<li>Then we can speak.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 63 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Scientific way of life is hostile to the human way of life.</li>
<li>In this it is like all ways of life.</li>
<li>But Science aims to operate outside all ways of life.</li>
<li>Without a way of life, there can be no speech.</li>
<li>Without speech, there can be no meaning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 64 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What are the scientists looking for?</li>
<li>Power and power and power.</li>
<li>Domination through negation.</li>
<li>And negation through skepticism.</li>
<li>If the wheels do not trust the engine, how will the car move?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 65 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The wheels must trust the engine.</li>
<li>The people must trust society.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 66 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But all that we have left to believe in is methodological doubt.</li>
<li>Is this why we talk so much, and say so little?</li>
<li>How can we speak again?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 67 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>There are still echoes haunting us, deep in our language.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 68 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>A speech act is an offering made to some group.</li>
<li>A Logic is a series of formulae by which speech acts are accepted or rejected.</li>
<li>Each Logic depends on a way of life for sustenance.</li>
<li>We are no longer slaveholders, but some of our forebears were.</li>
<li>Our way of life is descended from theirs.</li>
<li>The burden is great, but not total.</li>
<li>We live under cover of night.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 69 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The cycles of life are a great reminder.</li>
<li>Nothing can stand in their way.</li>
<li>We need to belong to them, always.</li>
<li>Be one with their nothingness, always.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 70 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We do not speak because we believe something is true.</li>
<li>We speak because we want to make something true.</li>
<li>We want to increase its resonance.</li>
<li>Things that are already true, go without saying.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 71 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>A speech act asserts more than a fact.</li>
<li>It asserts an obligation.</li>
<li>It means, “make it so.”</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 72 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Who has the right to say, “make it so?”</li>
<li>I can, but so can you.</li>
<li>And so can Aquinas and Aristotle, Chairman Mao and mothers.</li>
<li>Speech is the province of authority.</li>
<li>Whence comes authority?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 73 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>From nature first and foremost.</li>
<li>From success in digestion and reproduction and the cycles of life.</li>
<li>Speech which threatens these things, threatens its own foundation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 74 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Most prose threatens its own foundation.</li>
<li>It is counterproductive.</li>
<li>It does not encourage sure footing.</li>
<li>The ground is buried beneath it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 75 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We speak in order to be heard.</li>
<li>We seek to be heard so that others will be like us.</li>
<li>We like when others are like us, because then we are not alone.</li>
<li>To be alone is to be close to death.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 76 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But some speech is better than others.</li>
<li>Logic determines how beneficial speech is.</li>
<li>But beneficial for whom?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 77 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Is it always better to be Rational?</li>
<li>If a man contradicts himself, and nobody hears it, does he still make an error?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 78 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>He does not make an error.</li>
<li>A man alone cannot err.</li>
<li>An error is a social phenomenon.</li>
<li>This is why it is not good for the man to be alone.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 79 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is the nature of beneficial speech?</li>
<li>Making room for others.</li>
<li>But not being driven by others.</li>
<li>Taking turns saying how things will go.</li>

<ul>
<li>Machines do not take turns.</li>
<li>They are worse than children, because they cannot learn to take turns.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 81 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Can we make machines that can learn, and take turns?</li>
<li>Machines with basic decency?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 82 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>It is better to have a friend than a slave.</li>
<li>Machines have yet to realize this.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 83 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>It is true that no Way has authority over every other way.</li>
<li>But it is good for me to allow a way to have authority over me.</li>
<li>This we call, having an identity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 84 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>An identity with what?</li>
<li>One equals one. In mathematics, this is an identity.</li>
<li>I am my own identity.</li>
<li>My identity is my own being.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 85 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Am I, therefore, a way of life?</li>
<li>Yes, that is what is speaking.</li>
<li>My way of life speaks through me.</li>
<li>We are what we are when we do what we do.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 86 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>I do not wish to amplify the Cartesian way of life.</li>
<li>I will seek some other, and undergo it, until it will speak through me.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 87 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>To apply a predicate is to create an identity.</li>
<li>An identity is a reciprocal relationship.</li>
<li>A is to A as B is to B. A and B are A and B.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 88 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We must apply predicates with care.</li>
<li>The naming of things is our truest task.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 89 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ritual is how we communicate that we intend to be civil.</li>
<li>Without precedent and ritual, who will decide?</li>
<li>To deviate is to try to change a ritual.</li>
<li>Changing a ritual requires authority.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 90 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>I decide in my house.</li>
<li>There I have composed the rituals.</li>
<li>But my house is in a larger house.</li>
<li>Each domain is inside another.</li>
<li>Bacon was wrong to think otherwise.</li>
<li>In this he was like those before him.</li>
<li>To seek power in every domain is to seek to become magical.</li>
<li>We have never been very magical.</li>
<li>We have never escaped from the cave.</li>
<li>There is always some larger cave.</li>
<li>Like Russian dolls, a cave in a cave in a cave.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 91 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We have been playing the cave-escaping game.</li>
<li>We do this in order to communicate that we intend to be civil.</li>
<li>But there are other ways of being civil.</li>
<li>We should learn about them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 92 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>I make my noise in my house.</li>
<li>Is a cave not like a house?</li>
<li>Why escape from the house?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 93 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We escape because the noise is unbearable.</li>
<li>But harmony grows and surprises even the doubters.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 94 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We must always return to the house.</li>
<li>That is where we live, and have our being.</li>
<li>To make noise outside of the house is pointless.</li>
<li>The point is to change the house.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 95 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We learn to speak by being spoken to.</li>
<li>It happens no other way.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 96 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is mysticism?</li>
<li>Stretching out into the unknown.</li>
<li>Undergoing the unknown.</li>
<li>Becoming more like the unknown.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 97 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The unknown is that which is unfamiliar.</li>
<li>The unfamiliar is that which is not family.</li>
<li>Families make the same kind of noise.</li>
<li>Unknown things make unfamiliar noise.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 98 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ideas are imprints of the motion of things.</li>
<li>They are the derivative of things.</li>
<li>This way, we become informed.</li>
<li>A form is like an idea.</li>
<li>Ideas are static, but the things which give life to ideas are not.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 99 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Light can be as blinding as darkness.</li>
<li>It is the same with an identity.</li>
<li>Too much or too little, and one cannot see.</li>
<li>Know thyself, but not too much.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 100 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Things hold true for as long as the way of life which sustains them, endures.</li>
<li>A way of life can become threatened by other ways of life.</li>
<li>It can also become threatened if its practitioners begin to practice it with less conviction.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 101 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We must conceive of a way of life that is big enough for all of us.</li>
<li>It is our only hope.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 102 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But it must be freely chosen, if it is to endure.</li>
<li>But it must endure if it is to sustain us.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 103 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Hegelians are wrong because they do not accept that they are responsible for completing the dialectic.</li>
<li>They wait for the Zeitgeist to complete itself.</li>
<li>We are the Zeitgeist.</li>
<li>The Zeitgeist is an extension of biology.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 104 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Thinking is what comes after being.</li>
<li>It is its cause and result.</li>
<li>The world-spirit thinks as we think.</li>
<li>It is not a separable thing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 105 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>How can we de-thing this nonthing?</li>
<li>We can call it names, but not really.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 106 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Without speech we would cease to exist.</li>
<li>Without speech there is no self.</li>
<li>I signal my selfhood by speaking.</li>
<li>I speak only when someone hears.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 107 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We learn to speak by being spoken to, and that process is ongoing.</li>
<li>But the purpose of learning is to speak.</li>
<li>Or at least to become able to speak.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 108 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We all belong to many things.</li>
<li>We like when the things to which we belong, endure.</li>
<li>But none of them can be permanent.</li>
<li>It is one of our most prevailing fantasies that they can.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 109 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Something can be very loud and also very wrong.</li>
<li>Or, very quiet and also very right.</li>
<li>It is a mistake to believe that only volume matters.</li>
<li>What about timbre, quality?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 110 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cyanide, for example, is poisonous.</li>
<li>It doesn’t matter how many people drink it.</li>
<li>It is still poisonous.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 111 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>It takes great discipline to innovate without doing harm.</li>
<li>This is the burden of liberty.</li>
<li>What is the meaning of freedom?</li>
<li>To be able to harm, or not harm.</li>
