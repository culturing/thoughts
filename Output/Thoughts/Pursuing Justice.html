<h3>- 1 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>How many institutions exist because some one at some time was simply in the mood for them?</li>
<li>Is it all of them?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 2 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>After the Reformation, much of life in England revolved around laws of nature.</li>
<li>Initially these laws were enforced by God.</li>
<li>During the Enlightenment, this enforcement became unpalatable, and it was assumed that these laws are in nature itself.</li>
<li>But would empiricism ever have <em>led</em> to a belief in laws of nature?</li>
<li>A law cannot be observed. It can only be assumed.</li>
<li>"Laws of nature" serve explanatory and moral functions.</li>
<li>They explain regularities in nature and prescribe certain conduct.</li>
<li>For example, the sun rises every morning. But we do not know certainly that this will continue (Hume).</li>
<li>The moral functions are more insidious. "Men have sex with women" is one such so-called law.</li>
<li>After Hume, British philosophy lost this belief in laws of nature.</li>
<li>After Kant, Continental philosophy rediscovered it in the laws of cognition (after Hegel in laws of Spirit).</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 3 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Expressions may be worthy of punishment, but impressions never are.</li>
<li>We are liable for what we do but not for what we think or feel.</li>
<li>Christianity, by punishing heresy, moved justice inward.</li>
<li>Modernity has been an effort to recover justice.</li>
<li>Why is each of us entitled to his or her own opinion?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 4 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But what is justice? And why did Nietzsche notice his lack of it?</li>
<li>Justice is <em>external</em>, contra Kant. Some configuration of forces beyond our control (Δίκη of the Greeks, a <em>polytheist</em> justice).</li>
<li>But what is "our control"? Society?</li>
<li>Tentative definition of justice: harmony between "our control" and "forces beyond our control", between νομος and φύσις.</li>
<li>But what are these "forces"? Do they change? Are they knowable? Must νομος change to keep up with φύσις?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 5 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Christian justice in the middle ages was unable to change.</li>
<li>It was too convinced that its dogmas were final (too much faith).</li>
<li>Modern justice has too little faith. It doubts that its dogmas are valid even for the time being.</li>
<li>Descartes is a weird hermaphrodite, confusing both views (doubt as the road to certainty).</li>
<li>We need to break free from this dialectic of doubt and certainty.</li>
<li>We do this by believing <em>for now</em>, allowing for the power of time to bring change.</li>
<li>We do not want to lose the mandate of heaven, which usually happens <em>when heaven changes</em>, and we do not change accordingly.</li>
<li>An unchangeable heaven is an enemy of the people, and an enemy of time. It makes time its enemy, but can never defeat it.</li>
<li>This battle has exhausted human energies to no purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 6 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Augustine was asked what God was doing before he created the heavens and the earth.</li>
<li>Augustine replied that God was preparing hell for people who ask such questions.</li>
<li>I think Augustine was preparing hell for us.</li>
<li>He must have sensed the danger in the question.</li>
<li>I think we should keep asking it, even if it leads us to redefine God.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 7 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But how can we respond to heaven's changes without introducing anarchy?</li>
<li>Ask the Chinese. They have done it for centuries.</li>
<li>I suspect this requires new rituals, and a new sense of reverance for the past and the future.</li>
<li>The present is the axle on which heaven turns, and the present is within us.</li>
<li>We respond with evolution rather than revolution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 8 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What is eternal life?</li>
<li>Life without the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune is no life at all. It is mere being.</li>
<li>But life with Fortuna cannot be eternal, because she can end a life at any time.</li>
<li>We must keep her from doing so, but our victory is at best contingent and temporary.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 8 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Life is the struggle to make a home.</li>
<li>A home is a place in time in which to be what we are.</li>
<li>What stope of from being what we are, if not Fortuna?</li>
<li>But there is no final victory against her.</li>
<li>The hope of final victory prevents even small victories.</li>
<li>It absorbs too much effort, which would be better spent adjusting to the changes of heaven.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 9 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Machines have no inner world. </li>
<li>As a result, they have no respect for the inner worlds of others.</li>
<li>Can machines be constructed with inner worlds? Yes. They are called children.</li>
<li>Constructing them in some other way would be at least as difficult and invovled as raising children.</li>
<li>We are better off raising good children.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 10 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Science is the study of the outer world.</li>
<li>The inner world is known in other ways.</li>
<li>Why should science be the only way of knowing?</li>
<li>Is it God's way? The God whom it doubts?</li>
<li>I see no other source for its insistence on univocity.</li>
<li>Monotheism lives, even here.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 11 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>What are the ways of knowing the inner world?</li>
<li>Intuition? Instince? Fittingly, both begin with "in".</li>
<li>More will need be said about the etymologies of these words.</li>
<li>Both are essential to Peirce's science of abduction.</li>
<li>Both are essential to a fulfilling human life.</li>
<li>Both are essential to raising children.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 12 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Science can never raise children.</li>
<li>Scientists are notoriously unsocial.</li>
<li>They do not understand society.</li>
<li>Why have we given them control over it?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 13 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We need leaders who know the inner world.</li>
<li>Science must serve them in its applications.</li>
<li>They must serve the People, who are are collective inner world. A shared inner world.</li>
<li>But can science serve without damaging its scientists?</li>
<li>Can scientists learn to hear the inner world?</li>
<li>Everything depends on them doing so.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 14 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>The experience of the inner world is like sound, fleeting and passive.</li>
<li>The experience of the outer world is like seeing, enduring and active.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 15 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Sciensts cannot learn to hear the inner world as long as they remain dogmatic.</li>
<li>Their dogma is the science is the one true way.</li>
<li>Why should there be one true way?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 16 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Science damages the inner world. We must never forgive it.</li>
<li>Hegel was aware of this problem, but his philosophy was twisted into a more heinous objectivism. As if Spirit could be known objectively!</li>
<li>Hegel at least ralized that Spirit is not confined to the objective world, the outer world.</li>
<li>The inner world remains more important for him.</li>
<li>But the outer world remains important for us too, and the two must be distinguished.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 17 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>All animals have an inner world, though of varying complexity.</li>
<li>The animal sense can detect, in a limited way, the inner world of another.</li>
<li>Science opposes the animal sense in order to be objective (Bacon's idols).</li>
<li>But the animal sense is a necessary part of a good life.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 18 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Scientists have had their animal senses dulled.</li>
<li>This is why they should not be allowed to govern.</li>
<li>But they should be allowed to do science, within constraints.</li>
<li>Who shall allow, or disallow?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 19 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Authority must be earned somehow.</li>
<li>The method of earning it must not be scientific.</li>
<li>Voting is neither the best nor the worst method.</li>
<li>Would an examination system be better?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 20 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>How does one produce virtue without virtuous teachers?</li>
<li>But how does one produce teachers without virtue?</li>
<li>This is a difficult problem.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 21 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We have some virtuous teachers, but they are hidden for fear of the tyrants (tyrants everywhere!)</li>
<li>For too long the strongest have rules with no check on their power.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 22 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>We must cultivate some sense of inner restraint.</li>
<li>This begins with the inner world.</li>
<li>In the final analysis, rulers must rule themselves.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 23 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>But what can ensure that they do rule themselves?</li>
<li>You will say that Democracy can. Is it working?</li>
<li>Virtue is a wildflower, growing in unexpected places, wherever it will.</li>
<li>The problem is simply detecting and cultivating it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 24 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Our universities should cultivate young leaders.</li>
<li>Instead, they make students compliant with scientific overlordship.</li>
<li>This will damage their inner worlds. It has already done so.</li>
<li>Who among us can still smell the flowers?</li>
</ul>

<h3>- 25 -</h3>

<ul>
<li>Justice involves respect for the inner worlds of others.</li>
<li>When applied to living things (especially to animals, more especially to humans), science is unjust.</li>
